<h1><span class="GutSmall">THE</span><br />
JERUSALEM SINNER SAVED;<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OR,</span><br />
GOOD NEWS FOR THE VILEST OF MEN</h1>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">BEGINNING AT JERUSALEM</span>.&mdash;Luke xxiv.
47.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> whole verse runs thus:
&ldquo;And that repentance and remission of sins should be
preached in his name among all nations, beginning at
Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were spoken by Christ, after he rose from the dead,
and they are here rehearsed after an historical manner, but do
contain in them a formal commission, with a special clause
therein.&nbsp; The commission is, as you see, for the preaching
of the gospel, and is very distinctly inserted in the holy record
by Matthew and Mark.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go teach all nations,&rdquo;
&amp;c.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go ye into all the world, and preach the
gospel unto every creature.&rdquo;&nbsp; Matt. xxviii. 19; Mark
xvi. 15.&nbsp; Only this cause is in special mentioned by Luke,
who saith, That as Christ would have the doctrine of repentance
and remission of sins preached in his name among all nations, so
he would have the people of Jerusalem to have the first proffer
thereof.&nbsp; Preach it, saith Christ, in all nations, but begin
at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The apostles then, though they had a commission so large as to
give them warrant to go and preach the gospel in all the world,
yet by this clause they were limited as to the beginning of their
ministry: they were to begin this work at Jerusalem.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Beginning at Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before I proceed to an observation upon the words, I must (but
briefly) touch upon two things: namely,</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Show you what Jerusalem now was.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Show you what it was to preach the gospel to
them.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; For the first, Jerusalem is to be considered,
either,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; With respect to the descent of her people: or,</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; With respect to her preference and exaltation:
or,</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; With respect to her present state, as to her
decays.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, As to her descent: she was from Abraham, the
sons of Jacob, a people that God singled out from the rest of the
nations to set his love upon them.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, As to her preference or exaltation, she was
the place of God&rsquo;s worship, and that which had in and with
her the special tokens and signs of God&rsquo;s favour and
presence, above any other people in the world.&nbsp; Hence the
tribes went up to Jerusalem to worship; there was God&rsquo;s
house, God&rsquo;s high-priest, God&rsquo;s sacrifices accepted,
and God&rsquo;s eye, and God&rsquo;s heart perpetually; Psalm
lxxvi. 1, 2; Psalm cxxii.; 1 Kings ix. 3.&nbsp; But,</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>, We are to consider Jerusalem also in her
decays; for as she is so considered, she is the proper object of
our text, as will be further showed by and by.</p>
<p>Jerusalem, as I told you, was the place and seat of
God&rsquo;s worship, but now decayed, degenerated, and
apostatized.&nbsp; The word, the rule of worship, was rejected of
them, and in its place they had put and set up their own
traditions; they had rejected also the most weighty ordinances,
and put in the room thereof their own little things, Matt. xv.;
Mark vii.&nbsp; Jerusalem was therefore now greatly backsliding,
and become the place where truth and true religion were much
defaced.</p>
<p>It was also now become the very sink of sin and seat of
hypocrisy, and gulf where true religion was drowned.&nbsp; Here
also now reigned presumption, and groundless confidence in God,
which is the bane of souls.&nbsp; Amongst its rulers, doctors,
and leaders, envy, malice, and blasphemy vented itself against
the power of godliness, in all places where it was espied; as
also against the promoters of it; yea, their Lord and Maker could
not escape them.</p>
<p>In a word, Jerusalem was now become the shambles, the very
slaughter-shop for saints.&nbsp; This was the place wherein the
prophets, Christ, and his people, were most horribly persecuted
and murdered.&nbsp; Yea, so hardened at this time was this
Jerusalem in her sins, that she feared not to commit the biggest,
and to bind herself by wish under the guilt and damning evil of
it; saying, when she had murdered the Son of God, &ldquo;His
blood be upon us and our children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And though Jesus Christ did, both by doctrine, miracles, and
holiness of life, seek to put a stop to their villanies, yet they
shut their eyes, stopped their ears, and rested not, till, as was
hinted before, they had driven him out of the world.&nbsp; Yea,
that they might, if possible, have extinguished his name, and
exploded his doctrine out of the world, they, against all
argument, and in despite of Heaven, its mighty hand, and
undeniable proof of his resurrection, did hire soldiers to invent
a lie, saying, his disciples stole him away from the grave; on
purpose that men might not count him the Saviour of the world,
nor trust in him for the remission of sins.</p>
<p>They were, saith Paul, contrary to all men: for they did not
only shut up the door of life against themselves, but forbade
that it should be opened to any else.&nbsp; &ldquo;Forbidding
us,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;to preach to the Gentiles, that they
might be saved, to fill up their sins alway;&rdquo; Matt. xxiii.
35; chap. xv. 7&ndash;9; Mark vii. 6&ndash;8; Matt. iii.
7&ndash;9; John viii. 33, 41; Matt. xxvii. 18; Mark iii. 30;
Matt. xxiii. 37; Luke xiii. 33, 34; Matt. xxvii. 25; chap. xx.
11&ndash;16; 1 Thess. ii. 14&ndash;16.</p>
<p>This is the city, and these are the people; this is their
character, and these are their sins: nor can there be produced
their parallel in all this world.&nbsp; Nay, what world, what
people, what nation, for sin and transgression, could, or can be
compared to Jerusalem! especially if you join to the matter of
fact the light they sinned against, and the patience which they
abused.&nbsp; Infinite was the wickedness upon this account which
they committed.</p>
<p>After all their abusings of wise men, and prophets, God sent
unto them John Baptist, to reduce them, and then his Son to
redeem them; but they would be neither reduced nor redeemed, but
persecuted both to the death.&nbsp; Nor did they, as I said, stop
here; the holy apostles they afterwards persecuted also to death,
even so many as they could; the rest they drove from them unto
the utmost corners.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; I come now to show you what it was to preach the
gospel to them.&nbsp; It was, saith Luke, &ldquo;to preach to
them repentance and remission of sins&rdquo; in Christ&rsquo;s
name; or, as Mark has it, to bid them &ldquo;repent and believe
the gospel,&rdquo; Mark i. 15; not that repentance is a cause of
remission, but a sign of our hearty reception thereof.&nbsp;
Repentance is therefore here put to intimate, that no pretended
faith of the gospel is good that is not accompanied with it: and
this he doth on purpose, because he would not have them deceive
themselves: for with what faith can he expect remission of sins
in the name of Christ, that is not heartily sorry for them?&nbsp;
Or how shall a man be able to give to others a satisfactory
account of his unfeigned subjection to the gospel, that yet
abides in his impenitency?</p>
<p>Wherefore repentance is here joined with faith in the way of
receiving the gospel.&nbsp; Faith is that without which it cannot
be received at all; and repentance that without which it cannot
be received unfeignedly.&nbsp; When therefore Christ says, he
would have repentance and remission of sins preached in his name
among all nations, it is as much as to say, I will that all men
every where be sorry for their sins, and accept of mercy at
God&rsquo;s hand through me, lest they fall under his wrath in
the judgment.&nbsp; For as I had said, without repentance, what
pretence soever men have of faith, they cannot escape the wrath
to come.&nbsp; Wherefore Paul saith, God commands &ldquo;all men
every where to repent,&rdquo; (in order to their salvation),
&ldquo;because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge
the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath
ordained;&rdquo; Acts xvii. 31.</p>
<p>And now to come to this clause, &ldquo;Beginning at
Jerusalem;&rdquo; that is, that Christ would have Jerusalem have
the first offer of the gospel.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; This cannot be so commanded, because they had now any
more right of themselves thereto than had any of the nations of
the world; for their sins had divested them of all
self-deservings.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Nor yet, because they stood upon the advance-ground
with the worst of the sinners of the nations; nay, rather, the
sinners of the nations had the advance-ground of them: for
Jerusalem was, long before she had added this iniquity to her
sin, worse than the very nations that God cast out before the
children of Israel; 2 Chron. xxxiii.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; It must therefore follow, that this clause, Begin at
Jerusalem, was put into this commission of mere grace and
compassion, even from the overflowings of the bowels of mercy;
for indeed they were the worst, and so in the most deplorable
condition of any people under the heavens.</p>
<p>Whatever, therefore, their relation was to Abraham, Isaac, or
Jacob, however they formerly had been the people among whom God
had placed his name and worship, they were now degenerated from
God, more than the nations were from their idols, and were become
guilty of the highest sins which the people of the world were
capable of committing.&nbsp; Nay, none can be capable of
committing of such pardonable sins as they committed against
their God, when they slew his Son, and persecuted his name and
word.</p>
<p>From these words, therefore, thus explained, we gain this
observation:</p>
<p>That Jesus Christ would have mercy offered in the first place
to the biggest sinners.</p>
<p>That these Jerusalem sinners were the biggest sinners that
ever were in the world, I think none will deny, that believes
that Christ was the best man that ever was in the world, and also
was their Lord God.&nbsp; And that they were to have the first
offer of his grace, the text is as clear as the sun; for it
saith, &ldquo;Begin at Jerusalem.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Preach,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;repentance and remission
of sins&rdquo; to the Jerusalem sinners: to the Jerusalem sinners
in the first place.</p>
<p>One would a-thought, since the Jerusalem sinners were the
worst and greatest sinners, Christ&rsquo;s greatest enemies, and
those that not only despised his person, doctrine, and miracles,
but that a little before had had their hands up to the elbows in
his heart-blood, that he should rather have said, Go into all the
world, and preach repentance and remission of sins among all
nations; and after that offer the same to Jerusalem; yea, it had
been infinite grace, if he had said so.&nbsp; But what grace is
this, or what name shall we give it, when he commands that this
repentance and remission of sins, which is designed to be
preached in all nations, should first be offered to Jerusalem, in
the first place to the worst of sinners!</p>
<p>Nor was this the first time that the grace which was in the
heart of Christ thus shewed itself to the world.&nbsp; For while
he was yet alive, even while he was yet in Jerusalem, and
perceived even among these Jerusalem sinners, which was the most
vile amongst them, he still in his preaching did signify that he
had a desire that the worst of these worst should in the first
place come unto him.&nbsp; The which he showeth, where he saith
to the better sort of them, &ldquo;The publicans and harlots
enter into the kingdom of God before you;&rdquo; Matt. xxi.
31.&nbsp; Also when he compared Jerusalem with the sinners of the
nations, then he commands that the Jerusalem sinners should have
the gospel at present confined to them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go
not,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;into the way of the Gentiles, and
into any of the cities of the Samaritans enter ye not; but go
rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel;&rdquo; Matt. x.
5, 6; chap. xxiii. 37; but go rather to them, for they were in
the most fearful plight.</p>
<p>These therefore must have the cream of the gospel, namely, the
first offer thereof in his lifetime: yea, when he departed out of
the world, he left this as part of his last will with his
preachers, that they also should offer it first to
Jerusalem.&nbsp; He had a mind, a careful mind, as it seems, to
privilege the worst of sinners with the first offer of mercy, and
to take from among them a people to be the first fruits unto God
and to the Lamb.</p>
<p>The 15th of Luke also is famous for this, where the Lord Jesus
takes more care, as appears there by three parables, for the lost
sheep, lost groat, and the prodigal son, than for the other
sheep, the other pence, or for the son that said he had never
transgressed, yea, he shows that there is joy in heaven, among
the angels of God, at the repentance of one sinner, more than
over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance; Luke
xv.</p>
<p>After this manner therefore the mind of Christ was set on the
salvation of the biggest sinners in his lifetime.&nbsp; But join
to this, this clause, which he carefully put into the
apostles&rsquo; commission to preach, when he departed hence to
the Father, and then you shall see that his heart was vehemently
set upon it; for these were part of his last words with them,
Preach my gospel to all nations, but see that you begin at
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Nor did the apostles overlook this clause when their Lord was
gone into heaven: they went first to them of Jerusalem, and
preached Christ&rsquo;s gospel to them: they abode also there for
a season and time, and preached it to no body else, for they had
regard to the commandment of their Lord.</p>
<p>And it is to be observed, namely, that the first sermon which
they preached after the ascension of Christ, it was preached to
the very worst of these Jerusalem sinners, even to these that
were the murderers of Jesus Christ, Acts ii. 23, for these are
part of the sermon: &ldquo;Ye took him, and by wicked hands have
crucified and slain him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yea, the next sermon, and
the next, and also the next to that, was preached to the
self-same murderers, to the end they might be saved; Acts iii.
14&ndash;16; chap. iv. 10, 11; chap. v. 30; chap. vii. 52.</p>
<p>But we will return to the first sermon that was preached to
these Jerusalem sinners, by which will be manifest more than
great grace, if it be duly considered.</p>
<p>For after that Peter, and the rest of the apostles, had, in
their exhortation, persuaded these wretches to believe that they
had killed the Prince of life, and after they had duly fallen
under the guilt of their murder, saying, &ldquo;Men and brethren,
what shall we do?&rdquo; he replies, by an universal tender to
them all in general, considering them as Christ&rsquo;s killers,
that if they were sorry for what they had done, and would be
baptized for the remission of their sins in his name, they should
receive the gift of the Holy Ghost; Acts ii. 37, 38.</p>
<p>This he said to them all, though he knew that they were such
sinners.&nbsp; Yea, he said it without the least stick or stop,
or pause of spirit, as to whether he had best to say so or
no.&nbsp; Nay, so far off was Peter from making an objection
against one of them, that by a particular clause in his
exhortation, he endeavours, that not one of them may escape the
salvation offered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Repent,&rdquo; saith he,
&ldquo;and be baptized every one of you.&rdquo;&nbsp; I shut out
never a one of you; for I am commanded by my Lord to deal with
you, as it were, one by one, by the word of his salvation.&nbsp;
But why speaks he so particularly?&nbsp; Oh! there were reasons
for it.&nbsp; The people with whom the apostles were now to deal,
as they were murderers of our Lord, and to be charged in the
general with his blood, so they had their various and particular
acts of villany in the guilt thereof, now lying upon their
consciences.&nbsp; And the guilt of these their various and
particular acts of wickedness, could not perhaps be reached to a
removal thereof, but by this particular application.&nbsp; Repent
every one of you; be baptized every one of you, in his name, for
the remission of sins, and you shall, every one of you, receive
the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p><i>Object</i>.&nbsp; But I was one of them that plotted to
take away his life.&nbsp; May I be saved by him?</p>
<p><i>Peter</i>.&nbsp; Every one of you.</p>
<p><i>Object</i>.&nbsp; But I was one of them that bare false
witness against him.&nbsp; Is there grace for me?</p>
<p><i>Peter</i>.&nbsp; For every one of you.</p>
<p><i>Object</i>.&nbsp; But I was one of them that cried out,
Crucify him, crucify him; and desired that Barabbas the murderer
might live, rather than him.&nbsp; What will become of me, think
you?</p>
<p><i>Peter</i>.&nbsp; I am to preach repentance and remission of
sins to every one of you, says Peter.</p>
<p><i>Object</i>.&nbsp; But I was one of them that did spit in
his face when he stood before his accusers.&nbsp; I also was one
that mocked him, when in anguish he hanged bleeding on the
tree.&nbsp; Is there room for me?</p>
<p><i>Peter</i>.&nbsp; For every one of you, says Peter.</p>
<p><i>Object</i>.&nbsp; But I was one of them that in his
extremity said, give him gall and vinegar to drink.&nbsp; Why may
not I expect the same when anguish and guilt is upon me?</p>
<p><i>Peter</i>.&nbsp; Repent of these your wickednesses, and
here is remission of sins for every one of you.</p>
<p><i>Object</i>.&nbsp; But I railed on him, I reviled him, I
hated him, I rejoiced to see him mocked at by others.&nbsp; Can
there be hopes for me?</p>
<p><i>Peter</i>.&nbsp; There is for every one of you.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Repent and be baptised every one of you in the name of
Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the
gift of the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh! what a blessed
&ldquo;Every one of you,&rdquo; is here!&nbsp; How willing was
Peter, and the Lord Jesus, by his ministry, to catch these
murderers with the word of the gospel, that they might be made
monuments of the grace of God!&nbsp; How unwilling, I say, was
he, that any of these should escape the hand of mercy!&nbsp; Yea,
what an amazing wonder it is to think, that above all the world,
and above every body in it, these should have the first offer of
mercy!&nbsp; &ldquo;Beginning at Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But was there not something of moment in this clause of the
commission?&nbsp; Did not Peter, think you, see a great deal in
it, that he should thus begin with these men, and thus offer, so
particularly, this grace to each particular man of them?</p>
<p>But, as I told you, this is not all; these Jerusalem sinners
must have this offer again and again; every one of them must be
offered it over and over.&nbsp; Christ would not take their first
rejection for a denial, nor their second repulse for a denial;
but he will have grace offered once, and twice, and thrice, to
these Jerusalem sinners.&nbsp; Is not this amazing grace?&nbsp;
Christ will not be put off.&nbsp; These are the sinners that are
sinners indeed.&nbsp; They are sinners of the biggest sort;
consequently such as Christ can, if they convert and be saved,
best serve his ends and designs upon.&nbsp; Of which more
anon.</p>
<p>But what a pitch of grace is this!&nbsp; Christ is minded to
amaze the world, and to shew, that he acteth not like the
children of men.&nbsp; This is that which he said of old.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will not execute the fierceness of my wrath, I will not
return to destroy Ephraim; for I am God and not man;&rdquo; Hos.
xi. 9.&nbsp; This is not the manner of men; men are shorter
winded; men are soon moved to take vengeance, and to right
themselves in a way of wrath and indignation.&nbsp; But God is
full of grace, full of patience, ready to forgive, and one that
delights in mercy.&nbsp; All this is seen in our text.&nbsp; The
biggest sinners must first be offered mercy; they must, I say,
have the cream of the gospel offered unto them.</p>
<p>But we will a little proceed.&nbsp; In the third chapter we
find, that they who escaped converting by the first sermon, are
called upon again, to accept of grace and forgiveness, for their
murder committed upon the Son of God.&nbsp; You have killed, yea,
&ldquo;you have denied, the holy one and the just, and desired a
murderer to be granted unto you; and killed the Prince of
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mark, he falls again upon the very men that
actually were, as you have it in the chapters following, his very
betrayers and murderers, Acts iii. 14, 15; as being loath that
they should escape the mercy of forgiveness; and exhorts them
again to repent, that their sins might &ldquo;be blotted
out;&rdquo; verses 19, 20.</p>
<p>Again, in the fourth chapter, he charges them afresh with this
murder, ver. 10; but withal tells them, salvation is in no
other.&nbsp; Then, like a heavenly decoy, he puts himself also
among them, to draw them the better under the net of the gospel;
saying, &ldquo;There is none other name under heaven given among
men, whereby we must be saved;&rdquo; ver. 12.</p>
<p>In the fifth chapter you find them railing at him, because he
continued preaching among them salvation in the name of
Jesus.&nbsp; But he tells them, that that very Jesus whom they
had slain and hanged on a tree, him God had raised up, and
exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to
Israel, and forgiveness of sins: ver. 29&ndash;31.&nbsp; Still
insinuating, that though they had killed him, and to this day
rejected him, yet his business was to bestow upon them repentance
and forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis true, after they began to kill again, and when
nothing but killing would serve their turn, then they that were
scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.&nbsp; Yet
even some of them so hankered after the conversion of the Jews,
that they preached the gospel only to them.&nbsp; Also the
apostles still made their abode at Jerusalem, in hopes that they
might yet let down their net for another draught of these
Jerusalem sinners.&nbsp; Neither did Paul and Barnabas, who were
the ministers of God to the Gentiles, but offer the gospel, in
the first place, to those of them that for their wickedness were
scattered like vagabonds among the nations; yea, and when they
rendered rebellion and blasphemy for their service and love, they
replied, it was necessary that the word of God should first have
been spoken to them; Acts i. 8; chap. xiii. 46, 47.</p>
<p>Nor was this their preaching unsuccessful among these people:
but the Lord Jesus so wrought with the word thus spoken, that
thousands of them came flocking to him for mercy.&nbsp; Three
thousand of them closed with him at the first; and afterwards two
thousand more; for now they were in number about five thousand;
whereas before sermons were preached to these murderers, the
number of the disciples was not above &ldquo;a hundred and
twenty;&rdquo; Acts i. 15; chap. ii. 41; chap. iv. 4.</p>
<p>Also among these people that thus flocked to him for mercy,
there was a &ldquo;great company of the priests;&rdquo; chap. vi.
7.&nbsp; Now the priests were they that were the greatest of
these biggest sinners; they were the ringleaders, they were the
inventors and ringleaders in the mischief.&nbsp; It was they that
set the people against the Lord Jesus, and that were the cause
why the uproar increased, until Pilate had given sentence upon
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;The chief priests and elders,&rdquo; says the
text, &ldquo;persuaded (the people) the multitude,&rdquo; that
they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus; Matt. xxvii.
20.&nbsp; And yet behold the priests, yea, a great company of the
priests, became obedient to the faith.</p>
<p>Oh the greatness of the grace of Christ, that he should be
thus in love with the souls of Jerusalem sinners! that he should
be thus delighted with the salvation of the Jerusalem sinners!
that he should not only will that his gospel should be offered
them, but that it should be offered unto them first, and before
other sinners were admitted to a hearing of it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Begin at Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Were this doctrine well believed, where would there be a place
for a doubt, or a fear of the damnation of the soul, if the
sinner be penitent, how bad a life soever he has lived, how many
soever in number are his sins?</p>
<p>But this grace is hid from the eyes of men; the devil hides it
from them; for he knows it is alluring, he knows it has an
attracting virtue in it: for this is it that above all arguments
can draw the soul to God.</p>
<p>I cannot help it, but must let drop another word.&nbsp; The
first church, the Jerusalem church, from whence the gospel was to
be sent into all the world, was a church made up of Jerusalem
sinners.&nbsp; These great sinners were here the most shining
monuments of the exceeding grace of God.</p>
<p>Thus you see I have proved the doctrine; and that not only by
showing you that this was the practice of the Lord Jesus Christ
in his lifetime, but his last will when he went up to God;
saying, Begin to preach at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Yea, it is yet further manifested, in that when his ministers
first began to preach there, he joined his power to the word, to
the converting of thousands of his betrayers and murderers, and
also many of the ringleading priests to the faith.</p>
<p>I shall now proceed, and shall show you,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The reasons of the point:</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; And then make some application of the whole.</p>
<p>The observation, you know, is this: Jesus Christ would have
mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners, to the
Jerusalem sinners: &ldquo;Preach repentance, and remission of
sins, in my name, among all nations, beginning at
Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reasons of the point are:</p>
<p>First, Because the biggest sinners have most need
thereof.&nbsp; He that has most need, reason says, should be
helped first.&nbsp; I mean, when a helping hand is offered, and
now it is: for the gospel of the grace of God is sent to help the
world; Acts xvi. 9.&nbsp; But the biggest sinner has most
need.&nbsp; Therefore, in reason, when mercy is sent down from
heaven to men, the worst of men should have the first offer of
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Begin at Jerusalem.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the
reason which the Lord Christ himself renders, why in his lifetime
he left the best, and turned him to the worst; why he sat so
loose from the righteous, and stuck so close to the wicked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The whole,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;have no need of the
physician, but the sick.&nbsp; I came not to call the righteous,
but sinners to repentance;&rdquo; Mark ii. 15&ndash;47.</p>
<p>Above you read, that the scribes and pharisees said to his
disciples, &ldquo;How is it that he eateth and drinketh with
publicans and sinners?&rdquo;&nbsp; Alas! they did not know the
reason: but the Lord renders them one, and such an one as is both
natural and cogent, saying, These have need, most need.&nbsp;
Their great necessity requires that I should be most friendly,
and show my grace first to them.</p>
<p>Not that the other were sinless, and so had no need of a
Saviour; but the publicans and their companions were the biggest
sinners; they were, as to view, worse than the scribes; and
therefore in reason should be helped first, because they had most
need of a Saviour.</p>
<p>Men that are at the point to die have more need of the
physician than they that are but now and then troubled with an
heart-fainting qualm.&nbsp; The publicans and sinners were, as it
were, in the mouth of death; death was swallowing of them down:
and therefore the Lord Jesus receives them first, offers them
mercy first.&nbsp; &ldquo;The whole have no need of the
physician, but the sick.&nbsp; I came not to call the righteous,
but sinners to repentance.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sick, as I said, is
the biggest sinner, whether he sees his disease or not.&nbsp; He
is stained from head to foot, from heart to life and
conversation.&nbsp; This man, in every man&rsquo;s judgment, has
the most need of mercy.&nbsp; There is nothing attends him from
bed to board, and from board to bed again, but the visible
characters, and obvious symptoms, of eternal damnation.&nbsp;
This therefore is the man that has need, most need; and therefore
in reason should be helped in the first place.&nbsp; Thus it was
with the people concerned in the text, they were the worst of
sinners, Jerusalem sinners, sinners of the biggest size; and
therefore such as had the greatest need; wherefore they must have
mercy offered to them, before it be offered any where else in the
world.&nbsp; &ldquo;Begin at Jerusalem,&rdquo; offer mercy first
to a Jerusalem sinner.&nbsp; This man has most need, he is
farthest from God, nearest to hell, and so one that has most
need.&nbsp; This man&rsquo;s sins are in number the most, in cry
the loudest, in weight the heaviest, and consequently will sink
him soonest: wherefore he has most need of mercy.&nbsp; This man
is shut up in Satan&rsquo;s hand, fastest bound in the cords of
his sins: one that justice is whetting his sword to cut off; and
therefore has most need, not only of mercy, but that it should be
extended to him in the first place.</p>
<p>But a little further to show you the true nature of this
reason, to wit, That Jesus Christ would have mercy offered, in
the first place, to the biggest sinners.</p>
<p>First, Mercy ariseth from the bowels and compassion, from
pity, and from a feeling of the condition of those in
misery.&nbsp; &ldquo;In his love, and in his pity, he saveth
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again, &ldquo;The Lord is pitiful, very
pitiful, and of great mercy;&rdquo; Isa. lxiii. 9; James v.
11.</p>
<p>Now, where pity and compassion is, there is yearning of
bowels; and where there is that, there is a readiness to
help.&nbsp; And, I say again, the more deplorable and dreadful
the condition is, the more directly doth bowels and compassion
turn themselves to such, and offer help and deliverance.&nbsp;
All this flows from our first scripture proof; I came to call
them that have need; to call them first, while the rest look on
and murmur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How shall I give thee up, Ephraim?&rdquo;&nbsp; Ephraim
was a revolter from God, a man that had given himself up to
devilism: a company of men, the ten tribes, that worshipped
devils, while Judah kept with his God.&nbsp; &ldquo;But how shall
I give thee up, Ephraim?&nbsp; How shall I deliver thee,
Israel?&nbsp; How shall I make thee as Admah?&nbsp; How shall I
set thee as Zeboim? (and yet thou art worse than they: nor has
Samaria committed half thy sins); Ezek. xvi. 46&ndash;51.&nbsp;
My heart is turned within me, and my repentings are kindled
together;&rdquo; Hos. xi. 8.</p>
<p>But where do you find that ever the Lord did thus yearn in his
bowels for and after any self-righteous man?&nbsp; No, no; they
are the publicans and harlots, idolaters and Jerusalem sinners,
for whom his bowels thus yearn and tumble about within him: for,
alas! poor worms, they have most need of mercy.</p>
<p>Had not the good Samaritan more compassion for that man that
fell among thieves (though that fall was occasioned by his going
from the place where they worshipped God, to Jericho, the cursed
city) than we read he had for any other besides?&nbsp; His wine
was for him, his oil was for him, his beast for him; his penny,
his care, and his swaddling bands for him; for alas! wretch, he
had most need; Luke x. 30&ndash;35.</p>
<p>Zaccheus the publican, the chief of the publicans, one that
had made himself the richer by wronging of others; the Lord at
that time singled him out from all the rest of his brother
publicans, and that in the face of many Pharisees, and proclaimed
in the audience of them all, that that day salvation was come to
his house; Luke xix. 1&ndash;8.</p>
<p>The woman also that had been bound down by Satan for eighteen
years together, his compassions putting him upon it, he loosed
her, though those that stood by snarled at him for so doing; Luke
xiii. 11&ndash;13,</p>
<p>And why the woman of Sarepta, and why Naaman the Syrian,
rather than widows and lepers in Israel, but because their
conditions were more deplorable, (for that) they were most
forlorn, and farthest from help; Luke iv. 25, 27.</p>
<p>But I say, why all these, thus named? why have we not a
catalogue of some holy men that were so in their own eyes, and in
the judgment of the world?&nbsp; Alas if at any time any of them
are mentioned, how seemingly coldly doth the record of scripture
present them to us?&nbsp; Nicodemus, a night professor, and Simon
the pharisee, with his fifty pence; and their great ignorance of
the methods of grace, we have now and then touched upon.</p>
<p>Mercy seems to be out of his proper channel, when it deals
with self-righteous men; but then it runs with a full stream when
it extends itself to the biggest sinners.&nbsp; As God&rsquo;s
mercy is not regulated by man&rsquo;s goodness, nor obtained by
man&rsquo;s worthiness; so not much set out by saving of any
such.&nbsp; But more of this anon.</p>
<p>And here let me ask my reader a question: suppose that as thou
art walking by some pond side, thou shouldst espy in it four or
five children all in danger of drowning, and one in more danger
than all the rest, judge which has most need to be helped out
first?&nbsp; I know thou wilt say, he that is nearest
drowning.&nbsp; Why, this is the case; the bigger sinner, the
nearer drowning; therefore the bigger sinner the more need of
mercy; yea, of help by mercy in the first place.&nbsp; And to
this our text agrees, when it saith, &ldquo;Beginning at
Jerusalem.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let the Jerusalem sinner, says Christ,
have the first offer, the first invitation, the first tender of
my grace and mercy, for he is the biggest sinner, and so has most
need thereof.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, Christ Jesus would have mercy offered in the
first place to the biggest sinners, because when they, any of
them, receive it, it redounds most to the fame of his name.</p>
<p>Christ Jesus, as you may perceive, has put himself under the
term of a physician, a doctor for curing of diseases: and you
know that applause and fame, are things that physicians much
desire.&nbsp; That is it that helps them to patients, and that
also that will help their patients to commit themselves to their
skill for cure, with the more confidence and repose of
spirit.&nbsp; And the best way for a doctor or physician to get
himself a name, is, in the first place, to take in hand, and cure
some such as all others have given off for lost and dead.&nbsp;
Physicians get neither name nor fame by pricking of wheals, or
pricking out thistles, or by laying of plaisters to the scratch
of a pin; every old woman can do this.&nbsp; But if they would
have a name and a fame, if they will have it quickly they must,
as I said, do some great and desperate cures.&nbsp; Let them
fetch one to life that was dead; let them recover one to his wits
that was mad; let them make one that was born blind to see; or
let them give ripe wits to a fool; these are notable cures, and
he that can do thus, and if he doth thus first, he shall have the
name and fame he desires; he may lie a-bed till noon.</p>
<p>Why, Christ Jesus forgiveth sins for a name, and so begets of
himself a good report in the hearts of the children of men.&nbsp;
And therefore in reason he must be willing, as also he did
command, that his mercy should be offered first to the biggest
sinners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will forgive their sins, iniquities, and
transgressions,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and it shall turn to me
for a name of joy, and a praise and an honour, before all the
nations of the earth;&rdquo; Jer. xxxiii. 8, 9.</p>
<p>And hence it is, that at his first appearing he took upon him
to do such mighty works: he got a fame thereby, he got a name
thereby; Matt. iv. 23, 24.</p>
<p>When Christ had cast the legion of devils out of the man of
whom you read, Mark v., he bid him go home to his friends, and
tell it: &ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;to thy friends,
and tell them how great things God has done for thee, and has had
compassion on thee;&rdquo; Mark v. 19.&nbsp; Christ Jesus seeks a
name, and desireth a fame in the world; and therefore, or the
better to obtain that, he commands that mercy should first be
proffered to the biggest sinners, because, by the saving of one
of them he makes all men marvel.&nbsp; As &rsquo;tis said of the
man last mentioned, whom Christ cured towards the beginning of
his ministry: &ldquo;And he departed,&rdquo; says the text,
&ldquo;and began to publish in Decapolis, how great things Jesus
had done for him; and all men did marvel,&rdquo; ver. 20.</p>
<p>When John told Christ, that they saw one casting out devils in
his name, and they forbade him, because he followed not with
them, what is the answer of Christ?&nbsp; &ldquo;Forbid him not:
for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can
lightly speak evil of me.&rdquo;&nbsp; No; they will rather cause
his praise to be heard, and his name to be magnified, and so put
glory on the head of Christ.</p>
<p>But we will follow a little our metaphor: Christ, as I said,
has put himself under the term of a physician; consequently he
desireth that his fame, as to the salvation of sinners, may
spread abroad, and that the world may see what he can do.&nbsp;
And to this end, he has not only commanded, that the biggest
sinners should have the first offer of his mercy, but has, as
physicians do, put out his bills, and published his doings, that
things may be read and talked of.&nbsp; Yea, he has moreover, in
these his blessed bills, the holy scriptures I mean, inserted the
very names of persons, the places of their abode, and the great
cures that, by the means of his salvations, he has wrought upon
them to this very end.&nbsp; Here is, <i>Item</i>, such a one, by
my grace and redeeming blood, was made a monument of everlasting
life; and such a one, by my perfect obedience, became an heir of
glory.&nbsp; And then he produceth their names.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>, I saved Lot from the guilt and damnation that he
had procured to himself by his incest.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>, I saved David from the vengeance that belonged to
him for committing of adultery and murder.</p>
<p>Here is also Solomon, Manasseh, Peter, Magdalen, and many
others, made mention of in this book.&nbsp; Yea, here are their
names, their sins, and their salvations recorded together, that
you may read and know what a Saviour he is, and do him honour in
the world.&nbsp; For why are these things thus recorded, but to
show to sinners what he can do, to the praise and glory of his
grace?</p>
<p>And it is observable, as I said before, we have but very
little of the salvation of little sinners mentioned in
God&rsquo;s book, because that would not have answered the
design, to wit, to bring glory and fame to the name of the Son of
God.</p>
<p>What should be the reason, think you, why Christ should so
easily take a denial of the great ones, that were the grandeur of
the world, and struggle so hard for hedge-creepers and highwaymen
(as that parable, Luke xiv., seems to import he doth), but to
show forth the riches of the glory of his grace to his
praise?&nbsp; This I say, is one reason to be sure.</p>
<p>They that had their grounds, their yoke of oxen, and their
marriage joys, were invited to come; but they made their excuse,
and that served the turn.&nbsp; But when he comes to deal with
the worst, he saith to his servants, Go ye out and bring them in
hither.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go out quickly, and bring in hither the
poor, the maimed, the halt, and the blind.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they
did so: and he said again, &ldquo;Go out into the highways and
hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be
filled;&rdquo; Luke xiv. 18, 19, 23.&nbsp; These poor, lame,
maimed, blind, hedge-creepers and highwaymen, must come in, must
be forced in.&nbsp; These, if saved, will make his merits
shine.</p>
<p>When Christ was crucified, and hanged up between the earth and
heavens, there were two thieves crucified with him; and behold,
he lays hold of one of them and will have him away with him to
glory.&nbsp; Was not this a strange act, and a display of
unthought of grace?&nbsp; Were there none but thieves there, or
were the rest of that company out of his reach?&nbsp; Could he
not, think you, have stooped from the cross to the ground, and
have laid hold on some honester man if he would?&nbsp; Yes,
doubtless.&nbsp; Oh! but then he would not have displayed his
grace, nor so have pursued his own designs, namely, to get to
himself a praise and a name: but now he has done it to
purpose.&nbsp; For who that shall read this story, but must
confess, that the Son of God is full of grace; for a proof of the
riches thereof, he left behind him, when upon the cross he took
the thief away with him to glory.&nbsp; Nor can this one act of
his be buried; it will be talked of to the end of the world to
his praise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Men shall speak of the might of thy
terrible acts, and will declare thy greatness; they shall
abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing
of thy righteousness.&nbsp; They shall speak of the glory of thy
kingdom, and talk of thy power; to make known to the sons of men
his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom;&rdquo;
Psalm cxlv. 6&ndash;12.</p>
<p>When the word of God came among the conjurers and those
soothsayers that you read of, Acts xix., and had prevailed with
some of them to accept of the grace of Christ, the Holy Ghost
records it with a boast, for that it would redound to his praise,
saying, &ldquo;And many of them that used curious arts, brought
their books together, and burned them before all men: and counted
the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of
silver.&nbsp; So mightily grew the word of God, and
prevailed;&rdquo; Acts xix. 19, 20.&nbsp; It wrenched out of the
clutches of Satan some of those of whom he thought himself most
sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So mightily grew the word of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; It grew
mightily, it encroached upon the kingdom of the devil.&nbsp; It
pursued him, and took the prey; it forced him to let go his hold:
it brought away captive, as prisoners taken by force of arms,
some of the most valiant of his army: it fetched back from, as it
were, the confines of hell, some of those that were his most
trusty, and that with hell had been at an agreement: it made them
come and confess their deeds, and burn their books before all
men: &ldquo;So mightily grew the word of God, and
prevailed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, therefore, you see why Christ will have mercy offered in
the first place to the biggest sinners; they have most need
thereof; and this is the most ready way to extol his name that
rideth upon the heavens to our help.&nbsp; But,</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>, Christ Jesus would have mercy offered in the
first place to the biggest sinners, because by their forgiveness
and salvation, others hearing of it, will be encouraged the more
to come to him for life.</p>
<p>For the physician, by curing the most desperate at the first,
doth not only get himself a name, but begets encouragement in the
minds of other diseased folk to come to him for help.&nbsp; Hence
you read of our Lord, that after, through his tender mercy, he
had cured many of great diseases, his fame was spread abroad,
&ldquo;They brought unto him all sick people that were taken with
divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with
devils, and those which were lunatic, and those that had the
palsy, and he healed them.&nbsp; And there followed him great
multitudes of people from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem,
and Judea, and from beyond Jordan;&rdquo; Matt. iv. 24, 25.</p>
<p>See here, he first by working gets himself a fame, a name, and
renown, and now men take encouragement, and bring from all
quarters their diseased to him, being helped, by what they had
heard, to believe that their diseased should be healed.</p>
<p>Now, as he did with those outward cures, so he does in the
proffers of his grace and mercy: he proffers that in the first
place to the biggest sinners, that others may take heart to come
to him to be saved.&nbsp; I will give you a scripture or two, I
mean to show you that Christ, by commanding that his mercy should
in the first place be offered to the biggest of sinners, has a
design thereby to encourage and provoke others to come also to
him for mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God,&rdquo; saith Paul, &ldquo;who is rich in mercy,
for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead
in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ (by grace ye are
saved); and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together
in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; But why did he
do all this?&nbsp; &ldquo;That in the ages to come he might shew
the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us
through Christ Jesus;&rdquo; Eph. ii. 4&ndash;7.</p>
<p>See, here is a design; God lets out his mercy to Ephesus of
design, even to shew to the ages to come the exceeding riches of
his grace, in his kindness to them through Christ Jesus.&nbsp;
And why to shew by these the exceeding riches of his grace to the
ages to come, through Christ Jesus, but to allure them, and their
children also, to come to him, and to partake of the same grace
through Christ Jesus?</p>
<p>But what was Paul, and the Ephesian sinners? (of Paul we will
speak anon).&nbsp; These Ephesian sinners, they were men dead in
sins, men that walked according to the dictates and motions of
the devil; worshippers of Diana, that effeminate goddess; men far
off from God, aliens and strangers to all good things; such as
were far off from that, as I said, and consequently in a most
deplorable condition.&nbsp; As the Jerusalem sinners were of the
highest sort among the Jews, so these Ephesian sinners were of
the highest sort among the Gentiles; Eph. ii. 1&ndash;3, 11, 12;
Acts xix. 35.</p>
<p>Wherefore as by the Jerusalem sinners, in saving them first,
he had a design to provoke others to come to him for mercy, so
the same design is here set on foot again, in his calling and
converting the Ephesian sinners, &ldquo;That in the ages to come
he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;in his kindness towards us through Christ
Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is yet one hint behind.&nbsp; It is
said that God saved these for his love; that is, as I think, for
the setting forth, for the commendations of his love, for the
advance of his love, in the hearts and minds of them that should
come after.&nbsp; As who should say, God has had mercy upon, and
been gracious to you, that he might shew to others, for their
encouragement, that they have ground to come to him to be
saved.&nbsp; When God saves one great sinner, it is to encourage
another great sinner to come to him for mercy.</p>
<p>He saved the thief, to encourage thieves to come to him for
mercy; he saved Magdalen, to encourage other Magdalens to come to
him for mercy; he saved Saul, to encourage Sauls to come to him
for mercy; and this Paul himself doth say, &ldquo;For this
cause,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;I obtained mercy, that in me first
Jesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering for a pattern to
them which should hereafter believe on him to life
everlasting;&rdquo; 1 Tim. i. 16.</p>
<p>How plain are the words!&nbsp; Christ, in saving of me, has
given to the world a pattern of his grace, that they might see
and believe, and come, and be saved; that they that are to be
born hereafter might believe on Jesus Christ to life
everlasting.</p>
<p>But what was Paul?&nbsp; Why, he tells you himself; I am, says
he, the chief of sinners: I was, says he, a blaspheme; a
persecutor, an injurious person; but I obtained mercy; 1 Tim. i.
14, 15.&nbsp; Ay, that is well for you, Paul; but what advantage
have we thereby?&nbsp; Oh, very much, saith he; for, &ldquo;for
this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might
shew all long-suffering for a pattern to them which shall believe
on him to life everlasting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, therefore, you see that this third reason is of
strength, namely, that Jesus Christ would have mercy offered in
the first place to the biggest sinners, because, by their
forgiveness and salvation, others, hearing of it, will be
encouraged the more to come to him for mercy.</p>
<p>It may well therefore be said to God, Thou delightest in
mercy, and mercy pleases thee; Mich. vii. 18.</p>
<p>But who believes that this was God&rsquo;s design in shewing
mercy of old&mdash;namely, that we that come after might take
courage to come to him for mercy; or that Jesus Christ would have
mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners, to stir
up others to come to him for life?&nbsp; This is not the manner
of men, O God!</p>
<p>But David saw this betimes; therefore he makes this one
argument with God, that he would blot out his transgressions,
that he would forgive his adultery, his murders, and horrible
hypocrisy.&nbsp; Do it, O Lord, saith he, do it, and &ldquo;then
will I teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners shall be
converted unto thee;&rdquo; Psalm li. 7&ndash;13.</p>
<p>He knew that the conversion of sinners would be a work highly
pleasing to God, as being that which he had designed before he
made mountain or hill: wherefore he comes, and he saith, Save me,
O Lord; if thou wilt but save me, I will fall in with thy design;
I will help to bring what sinners to thee I can.&nbsp; And, Lord,
I am willing to be made a preacher myself; for that I have been a
horrible sinner: wherefore, if thou shalt forgive my great
transgressions, I shall be a fit man to tell of thy wondrous
grace to others.&nbsp; Yea, Lord, I dare promise, that if thou
wilt have mercy upon me, it shall tend to the glory of thy grace,
and also to the increase of thy kingdom; for I will tell it, and
sinners will hear on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And there is nothing so
suiteth with the hearing sinner as mercy, and to be informed that
God is willing to bestow it upon him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will teach
transgressors thy ways, and sinners shall be converted unto
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor will Christ Jesus miss of his design in proffering of
mercy in the first place to the biggest sinners.&nbsp; You know
what work the Lord, by laying hold of the woman of Samaria, made
among the people there.&nbsp; They knew that she was a town
sinner, an adulteress, yea, one that after the most audacious
manner lived in uncleanness with a man that was not her husband:
but when she, from a turn upon her heart, went into the city, and
said to her neighbours, &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; Oh how they came! how
they flocked out of the city to Jesus Christ!&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
they went out of the city, and came to him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And many of the Samaritans (people perhaps as bad as
herself) believed on him, for the saying of the woman, which
testified, saying, he told me all that ever I did;&rdquo; John
iv. 39.</p>
<p>That word, &ldquo;He told me all that ever I did,&rdquo; was a
great argument with them; for by that they gathered, that though
he knew her to be vile, yet he did not despise her, nor refuse to
shew how willing he was to communicate his grace unto her; and
this fetched over, first her, then them.</p>
<p>This woman, as I said, was a Samaritan sinner, a sinner of the
worst complexion: for the Jews abhorred to have ought to do with
them, ver. 9; wherefore none more fit than she to be made one of
the decoys of heaven, to bring others of these Samaritan
wild-fowls under the net of the grace of Christ.&nbsp; And she
did the work to purpose.&nbsp; Many, and many more of the
Samaritans believed on him; ver. 40&ndash;42.&nbsp; The heart of
man, though set on sin, will, when it comes once to a persuasion
that God is willing to have mercy upon us, incline to come to
Jesus Christ for life.</p>
<p>Witness those turn-aways from God that you also read of in
Jeremiah; for after they had heard three or four times over, that
God had mercy for backsliders, they broke out, and said,
&ldquo;Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Or as those in Hosea did, &ldquo;For in thee
the fatherless find mercy;&rdquo; Jer. iii. 22; Hos. xiv.
1&ndash;3.</p>
<p>Mercy, and the revelation thereof, is the only antidote
against sin.&nbsp; It is of a thawing nature; it will loose the
heart that is frozen up in sin; yea, it will make the unwilling
willing to come to Jesus Christ for life.&nbsp; Wherefore, do you
think, was it that Jesus Christ told the adulterous woman, and
that before so many sinners, that he had not condemned her, but
to allure her, with them there present, to hope to find favour at
his hands?&nbsp; (As he also saith in another place, &ldquo;I
came not to judge, but to save the world.&rdquo;)&nbsp; For might
they not thence most rationally conclude, that if Jesus Christ
had rather save than damn an harlot, there was encouragement for
them to come to him for mercy.</p>
<p>I heard once a story from a soldier, who with his company had
laid siege against a fort, that so long as the besieged were
persuaded their foes would shew them no favour, they fought like
madmen; but when they saw one of their fellows taken, and
received to favour, they all came tumbling down from their
fortress, and delivered themselves into their enemies&rsquo;
hands.</p>
<p>I am persuaded, did men believe that there is that grace and
willingness in the heart of Christ to save sinners, as the word
imports there is, they would come tumbling into his arms: but
Satan has blinded their minds, that they cannot see this
thing.&nbsp; Howbeit, the Lord Jesus has, as I said, that others
might take heart and come to him, given out a commandment, that
mercy should in the first place be offered to the biggest
sinners.&nbsp; &ldquo;Begin,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;at
Jerusalem.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thus I end the third reason.</p>
<p><i>Fourthly</i>, Jesus Christ would have mercy offered in the
first place to the biggest sinners, because that is the way, if
they receive it, most to weaken the kingdom of Satan, and to keep
it lowest in every age of the world.&nbsp; The biggest sinners,
they are Satan&rsquo;s colonels and captains, the leaders of his
people, and they that most stoutly make head against the Son of
God.&nbsp; Wherefore let these first be conquered, and his
kingdom will be weak.&nbsp; When Ishbosheth had lost his Abner,
his kingdom was made weak: nor did he sit but tottering then upon
his throne.&nbsp; So when Satan loseth his strong men, them that
are mighty to work iniquity, and dexterous to manage others in
the same, then is his kingdom weak; 2 Sam. iii.&nbsp; Therefore,
I say, Christ doth offer mercy in the first place to such, the
more to weaken his kingdom.&nbsp; Christ Jesus was glad to see
Satan fall like lightning from heaven, that is, suddenly or head
long; and it was, surely, by casting of him out of strong
possessions, and by recovering of some notorious sinners out of
his clutches; Luke x. 17&ndash;19.</p>
<p>Samson, when he would pull down the Philistines temple, took
hold of the two main pillars of it, and breaking them, down came
the house.&nbsp; Christ came to destroy the works of the devil,
and to destroy by converting grace, as well as by redeeming
blood.&nbsp; Now sin swarms, and lieth by legions, and whole
armies, in the souls of the biggest sinners, as in garrisons:
wherefore the way, the most direct way to destroy it, is first to
deal with such sinners by the word of his gospel, and by the
merits of his passion.</p>
<p>For example, though I shall give you but a homely one: suppose
a family to be troubled with vermin, and one or two of the family
to be in chief the breeders, the way, the quickest way to clear
that family, or at least to weaken the so swarming of those
vermin, is, in the first place, to sweeten the skin, head, and
clothes of the chief breeders; and then, though all the family
should be apt to breed them, the number of them, and so the
greatness of that plague there, will be the more impaired.</p>
<p>Why, there are some people that are in chief the devil&rsquo;s
sin-breeders in the towns and places where they live.&nbsp; The
place, town, or family where they live, must needs be horribly
verminous, as it were, eaten up with vermin.&nbsp; Now, let the
Lord Jesus, in the first place, cleanse these great breeders, and
there will be given a nip to those swarms of sins that used to be
committed in such places throughout the town, house, or family,
where such sin-breeding persons used to be.</p>
<p>I speak by experience: I was one of these verminous ones, one
of these great sin-breeders; I infected all the youth of the town
where I was born, with all manner of youthful vanities.&nbsp; The
neighbours counted me so; my practice proved me so: wherefore
Christ Jesus took me first, and taking me first, the contagion
was much allayed all the town over.&nbsp; When God made me sigh,
they would hearken, and enquiringly say, What is the matter with
John?&nbsp; They also gave their various opinions of me: but, as
I said, sin cooled, and failed, as to his full career.&nbsp; When
I went out to seek the bread of life, some of them would follow,
and the rest be put into a muse at home.&nbsp; Yea, almost the
town, at first, at times would go out to hear at the place where
I found good; yea, young and old for a while had some reformation
on them; also some of them, perceiving that God had mercy upon
me, came crying to him for mercy too.</p>
<p>But what need I give you an instance of poor I; I will come to
Manasseh the king.&nbsp; So long as he was a ring-leading sinner,
the great idolater, the chief for devilism, the whole land flowed
with wickedness; for he &ldquo;made them to sin,&rdquo; and do
worse than the heathen that dwelt round about them, or that was
cast out from before them: but when God converted him, the whole
land was reformed.&nbsp; Down went the groves, the idols, and
altars of Baal, and up went true religion in much of the power
and purity of it.&nbsp; You will say, The king reformed by
power.&nbsp; I answer, doubtless, and by example too; for people
observe their leaders; as their fathers did, so did they; 2
Chron. xxxiii. 2.</p>
<p>This, therefore, is another reason why Jesus would have mercy
offered in the first place to the biggest sinners, because that
is the best way, if they receive it, most to weaken the kingdom
of Satan, and to keep it poor and low.</p>
<p>And do you not think now, that if God would but take hold of
the hearts of some of the most notorious in your town, in your
family, or country, that this thing would be verified before your
faces?&nbsp; It would, it would, to the joy of you that are
godly, to the making of hell to sigh, to the great suppressing of
sin, the glory of Christ, and the joy of the angels of God.&nbsp;
And ministers should, therefore, that this work might go on, take
advantages to persuade with the biggest sinners to come into
Christ, according to my text, and their commissions;
&ldquo;Beginning at Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Fifthly</i>, Jesus Christ would have mercy offered, in the
first place, to the biggest sinners; because such, when
converted, are usually the best helps in the church against
temptations, and fittest for the support of the feeble-minded
there.&nbsp; Hence, usually, you have some such in the first
plantation of churches, or quickly upon it.&nbsp; Churches would
do but sorrily, if Christ Jesus did not put such converts among
them: they are the monuments and mirrors of mercy.&nbsp; The very
sight of such a sinner in God&rsquo;s house, yea, the very
thought of him, where the sight of him cannot be had, is ofttimes
greatly for the help of the faith of the feeble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the churches (said Paul) that were in Judea, heard
this concerning me, that he which persecuted them in time past,
now preached the faith which once he destroyed, they glorified
God in me;&rdquo; Gal. i. 20&ndash;24.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glorified God.&rdquo;&nbsp; How is that?&nbsp; Why,
they praised him, and took courage to believe the more in the
mercy of God; for that he had had mercy on such a great sinner as
he.&nbsp; They glorified God &ldquo;in me;&rdquo; they wondered
that grace should be so rich, as to take hold of such a wretch as
I was; and for my sake believed in Christ the more.</p>
<p>There are two things that great sinners are acquainted with,
when they come to divulge them to the saints, that are a great
relief to their faith.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The contests that they usually have with the devil at
their parting with him.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Their knowledge of his secrets in his workings.</p>
<p>For the <i>first</i>, The biggest sinners have usually great
contests with the devil at their partings; and this is an help to
saints: for ordinary saints find afterwards what the vile ones
find at first, but when at the opening of hearts, the one finds
himself to be as the other, the one is a comfort to the
other.&nbsp; The lesser sort of sinners find but little of this,
till after they have been some time in profession; but the vile
man meets with his at the beginning.&nbsp; Wherefore he, when the
other is down, is ready to tell that he has met with the same
before; for, I say, he has had it before.&nbsp; Satan is loath to
part with a great sinner.&nbsp; What my true servant (quoth he),
my old servant, wilt thou forsake me now? having so often sold
thyself to me to work wickedness, wilt thou forsake me now?&nbsp;
Thou horrible wretch, dost not know, that thou hast sinned
thyself beyond the reach of grace, and dost think to find mercy
now?&nbsp; Art not thou a murderer, a thief, a harlot, a witch, a
sinner of the greatest size, and dost thou look for mercy
now?&nbsp; Dost thou think that Christ will foul his fingers with
thee?</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis enough to make angels blush, saith Satan, to see so
vile a one knock at heaven-gates for mercy, and wilt thou be so
abominably bold to do it?&nbsp; Thus Satan dealt with me, says
the great sinner, when at first I came to Jesus Christ.&nbsp; And
what did you reply? saith the tempted.&nbsp; Why, I granted the
whole charge to be true, says the other.&nbsp; And what, did you
despair, or how?&nbsp; No, saith he, I said, I am Magdalen, I am
Zaccheus, I am the thief, I am the harlot, I am the publican, I
am the prodigal, and one of Christ&rsquo;s murderers: yea, worse
than any of these; and yet God was so far off from rejecting of
me (as I found afterwards), that there was music and dancing in
his house for me, and for joy that I was come home unto
him.&nbsp; O blessed be God for grace (says the other), for then
I hope there is favour for me.&nbsp; Yea, as I told you, such a
one is a continual spectacle in the church, for every one to
behold God&rsquo;s grace and wonder by.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, And as for the secrets of Satan, such as are
suggestions to question the being of God, the truth of his word,
and to be annoyed with devilish blasphemies; none more acquainted
with these than the biggest sinners at their conversion;
wherefore thus also they are prepared to be helps in the church
to relieve and comfort the other.</p>
<p>I might also here tell you of the contests and battles that
such are engaged in, wherein they find the besettings of Satan,
above any other of the saints.&nbsp; At which times Satan
assaults the soul with darkness, fears, frightful thoughts of
apparitions; now they sweat, pant, cry out, and struggle for
life.</p>
<p>The angels now come down to behold the sight, and rejoice to
see a bit of dust and ashes to overcome principalities and
powers, and might, and dominions.&nbsp; But, as I said when these
come a little to be settled, they are prepared for helping
others, and are great comforts unto them.&nbsp; Their great sins
give great encouragement to the devil to assault them; and by
these temptations Christ takes advantage to make them the more
helpful to the churches.</p>
<p>The biggest sinner, when he is converted, and comes into the
church, says to them all, by his very coming in, Behold me, all
you that are men and women of a low and timorous spirit, you
whose hearts are narrow, for that you never had the advantage to
know, because your sins are few, the largeness of the grace of
God.&nbsp; Behold, I say, in me, the exceeding riches of his
grace!&nbsp; I am a pattern set forth before your faces, on whom
you may look and take heart.&nbsp; This, I say, the great sinner
can say, to the exceeding comfort of all the rest.</p>
<p>Wherefore, as I have hinted before, when God intends to stock
a place with saints, and to make that place excellently to
flourish with the riches of his grace, he usually begins with the
conversion of some of the most notorious thereabouts, and lays
them as an example to allure others, and to build up when they
are converted.</p>
<p>It was Paul that must go to the Gentiles, because Paul was the
most outrageous of all the apostles, in the time of his
unregeneracy.&nbsp; Yea, Peter must be he, that after his
horrible fall, was thought fittest, when recovered again, to
comfort and strengthen his brethren.&nbsp; See Luke xxii. 31,
32.</p>
<p>Some must be pillars in God&rsquo;s house; and if they be
pillars of cedar, they must stand while they are stout and sturdy
sticks in the forest, before they are cut down, and planted or
placed there.</p>
<p>No man, when he buildeth his house, makes the principal parts
thereof of weak or feeble timber; for how could such bear up the
rest? but of great and able wood.&nbsp; Christ Jesus also goeth
this way to work; he makes of the biggest sinners bearers and
supporters to the rest.&nbsp; This then, may serve for another
reason, why Jesus Christ gives out in commandment, that mercy
should, in the first place, be offered to the biggest sinners:
because such, when converted, are usually the best helps in the
church against temptations, and fittest for the support of the
feeble-minded there.</p>
<p><i>Sixthly</i>, Another reason why Jesus Christ would have
mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners, is,
because they, when converted, are apt to love him most.</p>
<p>This agrees both with Scripture and reason.&nbsp; Scripture
says so: &ldquo;To whom much is forgiven, the same loveth
much.&nbsp; To whom little is forgiven, the same loveth
little;&rdquo; Luke vii. 47.&nbsp; Reason says so: for as it
would be the unreasonablest thing in the world to render hatred
for love, and contempt for forgiveness; so it would be as
ridiculous to think, that the reception of a little kindness
should lay the same obligations upon the heart to love, as the
reception of a great deal.&nbsp; I would not disparage the love
of Christ; I know the least drachm of it, when it reaches to
forgiveness, is great above all the world; but comparatively,
there are greater extensions of the love of Christ to one than to
another.&nbsp; He that has most sin, if forgiven, is partaker of
the greatest love, of the greatest forgiveness.</p>
<p>I know also, that there are some, that from this very doctrine
say, &ldquo;Let us do evil that good may come;&rdquo; and that
turn the grace of our God into lasciviousness.&nbsp; But I speak
not of these; these will neither be ruled by grace nor
reason.&nbsp; Grace would teach them, if they know it, to deny
ungodly courses; and so would reason too, if it could truly sense
the love of God; Titus ii. 11, 12; Rom. xi. 1.</p>
<p>Doth it look like what hath any coherence with reason or
mercy, for a man to abuse his friend?&nbsp; Because Christ died
for men, shall I therefore spit in his face?&nbsp; The bread and
water that was given by Elisha to his enemies, that came into the
land of Israel to take him, had so much influence upon their
minds, though heathens, that they returned to their homes without
hurting him: yea, it kept them from coming again in a hostile
manner into the coasts of Israel; 2 Kings vi. 19&ndash;23.</p>
<p>But to forbear to illustrate till anon.&nbsp; One reason why
Christ Jesus shews mercy to sinners, is, that he might obtain
their love, that he may remove their base affections from base
objects to himself.&nbsp; Now, if he loves to be loved a little,
he loves to be loved much; but there is not any that are capable
of loving much, save those that have much forgiven them.&nbsp;
Hence it is said of Paul, that he laboured more than them all; to
wit, with a labour of love, because he had been by sin more vile
against Christ than they all; 1 Cor. xv.&nbsp; He it was that
persecuted the church of God, and wasted it; Gal. i. 13.&nbsp; He
of them all was the only raving bedlam against the saints:
&ldquo;And being exceeding mad,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;against
them, I persecuted them, even to strange cities;&rdquo; Acts
xxvi. 11.</p>
<p>This raving bedlam, that once was so, is he that now says, I
laboured more than them all, more for Christ than them all.</p>
<p>But Paul, what moved thee thus to do?&nbsp; The love of
Christ, says he.&nbsp; It was not I, but the grace of God that
was with me.&nbsp; As who should say, O grace!&nbsp; It was such
grace to save me!&nbsp; It was such marvellous grace for God to
look down from heaven upon me, and that secured me from the wrath
to come, that I am captivated with the sense of the riches of
it.&nbsp; Hence I act, hence I labour; for how can I otherwise
do, since God not only separated me from my sins and companions,
but separated all the powers of my soul and body to his
service?&nbsp; I am therefore prompted on by this exceeding love
to labour as I have done; yet not I, but the grace of God with
me.</p>
<p>Oh!&nbsp; I shall never forget his love, nor the circumstances
under which I was, when his love laid hold upon me.&nbsp; I was
going to Damascus with letters from the high-priest, to make
havock of God&rsquo;s people there, as I had made havock of them
in other places.&nbsp; These bloody letters were not imposed upon
me.&nbsp; I went to the high-priest and desired them of him; Acts
ix. 1, 2; and yet he saved me!&nbsp; I was one of the men, of the
chief men, that had a hand in the blood of his martyr Stephen;
yet he had mercy on me!&nbsp; When I was at Damascus, I stunk so
horribly like a blood-sucker, that I became a terror to all
thereabout.&nbsp; Yea, Ananias (good man) made intercession to my
Lord against me; yet he would have mercy upon me, yea, joined
mercy to mercy, until he had made me a monument of grace!&nbsp;
He made a saint of me, and persuaded me that my transgressions
were forgiven me.</p>
<p>When I began to preach, those that heard me were amazed, and
said, &ldquo;Is not this he that destroyed them that called on
this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he
might bring them bound to the high-priest?&rdquo;&nbsp; Hell doth
know that I was a sinner; heaven doth know that I was a sinner;
the world also knows that I was a sinner, a sinner of the
greatest size; but I obtained mercy; 1 Tim i. 15, 16.</p>
<p>Shall not this lay obligation upon me?&nbsp; Is not love of
the greatest force to oblige?&nbsp; Is it not strong as death,
cruel as the grave, and hotter than the coals of juniper?&nbsp;
Hath it not a most vehement flame? can the waters quench it? can
the floods drown it?&nbsp; I am under the force of it, and this
is my continual cry, What shall I render to the Lord for all the
benefits which he has bestowed upon me?</p>
<p>Ay, Paul! this is something; thou speakest like a man, like a
man affected, and carried away with the love and grace of
God.&nbsp; Now, this sense, and this affection, and this labour,
giveth to Christ the love that he looks for.&nbsp; But he might
have converted twenty little sinners, and yet not found, for
grace bestowed, so much love in them all.</p>
<p>I wonder how far a man might go among the converted sinners of
the smaller size, before one could find one that so much as
looked any thing this wayward.&nbsp; Where is he that is thus
under pangs of love for the grace bestowed upon him by Jesus
Christ?&nbsp; Excepting only some few, you may walk to the
world&rsquo;s end, and find none.&nbsp; But, as I said, some
there are, and so there has been in every age of the church,
great sinners, that have had much forgiven them; and they love
much upon this account.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ therefore knows what he doth, when he lays hold
on the hearts of sinners of the biggest size.&nbsp; He knows that
such an one will love more than many that have not sinned half
their sins.</p>
<p>I will tell you a story that I have read of Martha and Mary;
the name of the book I have forgot; I mean of the book in which I
found the relation; but the thing was thus: Martha, saith my
author, was a very holy woman, much like Lazarus her brother; but
Mary was a loose and wanton creature; Martha did seldom miss good
sermons and lectures, when she could come at them in Jerusalem;
but Mary would frequent the house of sports, and the company of
the vilest of men for lust: And though Martha had often desired
that her sister would go with her to hear her preachers, yea, had
often entreated her with tears to do it, yet could she never
prevail; for still Mary would make her excuse, or reject her with
disdain for her zeal and preciseness in religion.</p>
<p>After Martha had waited long, tried many ways to bring her
sister to good, and all proved ineffectual, at last she comes
upon her thus: &ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; quoth she, &ldquo;I pray
thee go with me to the temple to-day, to hear one preach a
sermon.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What kind of preacher is he?&rdquo;
said she.&nbsp; Martha replied, &ldquo;It is one Jesus of
Nazareth; he is the handsomest man that ever you saw with your
eyes.&nbsp; Oh! he shines in beauty, and is a most excellent
preacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, what does Mary, after a little pause, but goes up into
her chamber, and with her pins and her clouts, decks up herself
as fine as her fingers could make her.</p>
<p>This done, away she goes, not with her sister Martha, but as
much unobserved as she could, to the sermon, or rather to see the
preacher.</p>
<p>The hour and preacher being come, and she having observed
whereabout the preacher would stand, goes and sets herself so in
the temple, that she might be sure to have the full view of this
excellent person.&nbsp; So he comes in, and she looks, and the
first glimpse of his person pleased her.&nbsp; Well, Jesus
addresseth himself to his sermon, and she looks earnestly on
him.</p>
<p>Now, at that time, saith my author, Jesus preached about the
lost sheep, the lost groat, and the prodigal child.&nbsp; And
when he came to shew what care the shepherd took for one lost
sheep, and how the woman swept to find her piece which was lost,
and what joy there was at their finding, she began to be taken by
the ears, and forgot what she came about, musing what the
preacher would make of it.&nbsp; But when he came to the
application, and shewed, that by the lost sheep was meant a great
sinner; by the shepherd&rsquo;s care, was meant God&rsquo;s love
for great sinners; and that by the joy of the neighbours, was
shewed what joy there was among the angels in heaven over one
great sinner that repenteth; she began to be taken by the
heart.&nbsp; And as he spake these last words, she thought he
pitched his innocent eyes just upon her, and looked as if he
spake what was now said to her: wherefore her heart began to
tremble, being shaken with affection and fear; then her eyes ran
down with tears apace; wherefore she was forced to hide her face
with her handkerchief; and so sat sobbing and crying all the rest
of the sermon.</p>
<p>Sermon being done, up she gets, and away she goes, and withal
inquired where this Jesus the preacher dined that day? and one
told her, At the house of Simon the Pharisee.&nbsp; So away goes
she, first to her chamber, and there strips herself of her wanton
attire: then falls upon her knees to ask God forgiveness for all
her wicked life.&nbsp; This done, in a modest dress she goes to
Simon&rsquo;s house, where she finds Jesus sat at dinner.&nbsp;
So she gets behind him, and weeps, and drops her tears upon his
feet like rain, and washes them, and wipes them with the hair of
her head.&nbsp; She also kissed his feet with her lips, and
anointed them with ointment.&nbsp; When Simon the Pharisee
perceived what the woman did, and being ignorant of what it was
to be forgiven much (for he never was forgiven more than fifty
pence), he began to think within himself, that he had been
mistaken about Jesus Christ, because he suffered such a sinner as
this woman was, to touch him.&nbsp; Surely, quoth he, this man,
if he were a prophet, would not let this woman come near him, for
she is a town-sinner (so ignorant are all self-righteous men of
the way of Christ with sinners.)&nbsp; But lest Mary should be
discouraged with some clownish carriage of this Pharisee and so
desert her good beginnings, and her new steps which she now had
begun to take towards eternal life, Jesus began thus with
Simon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Simon,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;I have
somewhat to say unto thee.&nbsp; And he saith, Master, say
on.&nbsp; There was,&rdquo; said Jesus, &ldquo;a certain creditor
had two debtors; the one owed five hundred pence, and the other
fifty.&nbsp; And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave
them both.&nbsp; Tell me therefore which of them will love him
most?&nbsp; Simon answered and said, I suppose that he to whom he
forgave most.&nbsp; And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly
judged.&nbsp; And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon,
Seest thou this woman?&nbsp; I entered into thy house, thou
gavest me no water for my feet; but she hath washed my feet with
tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.&nbsp; Thou
gavest me no kiss: but this woman, since the time I came in, hath
not ceased to kiss my feet.&nbsp; My head with oil thou didst not
anoint, but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.&nbsp;
Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins which are many, are forgiven,
for she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, the same
loveth little.&nbsp; And he said unto her, Thy sins are
forgiven;&rdquo; Luke vii. 36&ndash;50.</p>
<p>Thus you have the story.&nbsp; If I come short in any
circumstance, I beg pardon of those that can correct me.&nbsp; It
is three or four and twenty years since I saw the book: yet I
have, as far as my memory will admit, given you the relation of
the matter.&nbsp; However Luke, as you see, doth here present you
with the substance of the whole.</p>
<p>Alas!&nbsp; Christ Jesus has but little thanks for the saving
of little sinners.&nbsp; &ldquo;To whom little is forgiven, the
same loveth little.&rdquo;&nbsp; He gets not water for his feet,
by his saving of such sinners.&nbsp; There are abundance of
dry-eyed Christians in the world, and abundance of dry-eyed
duties too; duties that never were wetted with the tears of
contrition and repentance, nor ever sweetened with the great
sinner&rsquo;s box of ointment.&nbsp; And the reason is, such
sinners have not great sins to be saved from; or if they have,
they look upon them in the diminishing glass of the holy law of
God.&nbsp; But I rather believe, that the professors of our days
want a due sense of what they are; for, verily, for the
generality of them, both before and since conversion, they have
been sinners of a lusty size.&nbsp; But if their eyes be holden,
if convictions are not shewn, if their knowledge of their sins is
but like to the eye-sight in twilight; the heart cannot be
affected with that grace that has laid hold on the man; and so
Christ Jesus sows much, and has little coming in.</p>
<p>Wherefore his way is ofttimes to step out of the way, to
Jericho, to Samaria, to the country of the Gadarenes, to the
coasts of Tyre and Sidon, and also to Mount Calvary, that he may
lay hold of such kind of sinners as will love him to his liking;
Luke xix. 1&ndash;11; John iv. 3&ndash;11; Mark v. 1&ndash;21;
Matt. xv. 21&ndash;29; Luke xxiii. 33&ndash;44.</p>
<p>But thus much for the sixth reason, why Christ Jesus would
have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners, to
wit, because such sinners, when converted, are apt to love him
most.&nbsp; The Jerusalem sinners were they that outstripped,
when they were converted, in some things, all the churches of the
Gentiles.&nbsp; &ldquo;They were of one heart, and of one soul,
neither said any of them, that aught of the things that they
possessed was their own.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Neither was there
any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of
lands or houses sold them, and brought the price of the things
that were sold, and laid them down at the apostles&rsquo;
feet,&rdquo; &amp;c.; Acts iv. 32&ndash;35.&nbsp; Now, shew me
such another pattern if you can.&nbsp; But why did these do
thus?&nbsp; Oh! they were Jerusalem sinners.&nbsp; These were the
men that but a little before had killed the Prince of Life; and
those to whom he did, that notwithstanding, send the first offer
of grace and mercy.&nbsp; And the sense of this took them up
betwixt the earth and the heaven, and carried them on in such
ways and methods as could never be trodden by any since.&nbsp;
They talk of the church of Rome, and set her in her primitive
state, as a pattern and mother of churches; when the truth is,
they were the Jerusalem sinners, when converts, that out-did all
the churches that ever were.</p>
<p><i>Seventhly</i>, Christ Jesus would have mercy offered, in
the first place, to the biggest sinners; because grace when it is
received by such, finds matter to kindle upon more freely than it
finds in other sinners.&nbsp; Great sinners are like the dry
wood, or like great candles, which burn best and shine with
biggest light.&nbsp; I lay not this down, as I did those reasons
before, to shew, that when great sinners are converted, they will
be encouragement to others, though that is true; but to shew that
Christ has a delight to see grace, the grace we receive, to
shine.&nbsp; We love to see things that bear a good gloss; yea,
we choose to buy such kind of matter to work upon, as will, if
wrought up to what we intend, cast that lustre that we
desire.</p>
<p>Candles that burn not bright, we like not: wood that is green
will rather smother, and sputter, and smoke, and crack, and
flounce, than cast a brave light and a pleasant heat: wherefore
great folks care not much, not so much for such kind of things,
as for them that will better answer their ends.</p>
<p>Hence Christ desires the biggest sinner; in him there is
matter to work by, to wit, a great deal of sin; for as by the
tallow of the candle, the fire takes occasion to burn the
brighter; so by the sin of the soul, grace takes occasion to
shine the clearer.&nbsp; Little candles shine but little, for
there wanteth matter for the fire to work upon; but in the great
sinner, here is more matter for grace to work by.&nbsp; Faith
shines, when it worketh towards Christ, through the sides of many
and great transgressors, and so does love, for that much is
forgiven.&nbsp; And what matter can be found in the soul for
humility to work by so well, as by a sight that I have been and
am an abominable sinner?&nbsp; And the same is to be said of
patience, meekness, gentleness, self-denial, or of any other
grace.&nbsp; Grace takes occasion by the vileness of the man to
shine the more; even as by the ruggedness of a very strong
distemper or disease, the virtue of the medicine is best made
manifest.&nbsp; Where sin abounds, grace much more abounds; Rom.
v. 20.&nbsp; A black string makes the neck look whiter; great
sins make grace burn clear.&nbsp; Some say, when grace and a good
nature meet together, they do make shining Christians: but I say,
when grace and a great sinner meet, and when grace shall subdue
that great sinner to itself, and shall operate after its kind in
the soul of that great sinner, then we have a shining Christian;
witness all those of whom mention was made before.</p>
<p>Abraham was among the idolaters when in the land of Assyria,
and served idols with his kindred on the other side of the flood;
Jos. xxiv. 2; Gen. xi. 31.&nbsp; But who, when called, was there
in the world, in whom grace shone so bright as in him?</p>
<p>The Thessalonians were idolaters before the word of God came
to them; but when they had received it, they became examples to
all that did believe in Macedonia and Achaia; 1 Thess. i.
6&ndash;10.</p>
<p>God the Father, and Jesus Christ his Son, are for having
things seen, for having the word of life held forth.&nbsp; They
light not a candle that it might be put under a bushel, or under
a bed, but on a candlestick, that all that come in may see the
light; Matt. v. 15; Mark iv. 21; Luke viii. 16; chap. xi. 33.</p>
<p>And, I say, as I said before, in whom is light like so to
shine, as in the souls of great sinners?</p>
<p>When the Jewish Pharisees dallied with the gospel, Christ
threatened to take it from them, and to give it to the barbarous
heathens and idolaters.&nbsp; Why so?&nbsp; For they, saith he,
will bring forth the fruits thereof in their season:
&ldquo;Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be
taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits
thereof;&rdquo; Matt. xxi. 41&ndash;43.</p>
<p>I have often marvelled at our youth, and said in my heart,
What should be the reason that they should be so generally at
this day debauched as they are?&nbsp; For they are now profane to
amazement; and sometimes I have thought one thing, and sometimes
another; that is, why God should suffer it so to be.&nbsp; At
last I have thought of this: How if the God, whose ways are past
finding out, should suffer it so to be now, that he might make of
some of them the more glorious saints hereafter.&nbsp; I know sin
is of the devil, but it cannot work in the world without
permission: and if it happens to be as I have thought, it will
not be the first time that God the Lord hath caught Satan in his
own design.&nbsp; For my part, I believe that the time is at
hand, that we shall see better saints in the world than has been
seen in it this many a day.&nbsp; And this vileness, that at
present does so much swallow up our youth, is one cause of my
thinking so: for out of them, for from among them, when God sets
to his hand, as of old, you shall see what penitent ones, what
trembling ones, and what admirers of grace, will be found to
profess the gospel to the glory of God by Christ.</p>
<p>Alas! we are a company of worn-out Christians, our moon is in
the wane; we are much more black than white, more dark than
light; we shine but a little; grace in the most of us is
decayed.&nbsp; But I say, when they of these debauched ones that
are to be saved shall be brought in, when these that look more
like devils than men shall be converted to Christ (and I believe
several of them will), then will Christ be exalted, grace adored,
the word prized, Zion&rsquo;s path better trodden, and men in the
pursuit of their own salvation, to the amazement of them that are
left behind.</p>
<p>Just before Christ came into the flesh, the world was
degenerated as it is now: the generality of the men in Jerusalem,
were become either high and famous for hypocrisy, or filthy base
in their lives.&nbsp; The devil also was broke loose in a hideous
manner, and had taken possession of many: yea, I believe that
there was never generation before nor since, that could produce
so many possessed with devils, deformed, lame, blind, and
infected with monstrous diseases, as that generation could.&nbsp;
But what was the reason thereof, I mean the reason from
God?&nbsp; Why one (and we may sum up more in that answer that
Christ gave to his disciples concerning him that was born blind)
was, that the works of God might be made manifest in them, and
that the Son of God might be glorified thereby, John ix. 2, 3;
chap. xi. 4.</p>
<p>Now if these devils and diseases, as they possessed men then,
were to make way and work for an approaching Christ in person,
and for the declaring of his power, why may we not think that
now, even now also, he is ready to come by his Spirit in the
gospel to heal many of the debaucheries of our age?&nbsp; I
cannot believe that grace will take them all, for there are but
few that are saved; but yet it will take some, even some of the
worst of men, and make blessed ones of them.&nbsp; But, O how
these ringleaders in vice will then shine in virtue!&nbsp; They
will be the very pillars in churches, they will be as an ensign
in the land.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lord their God shall save them in
that day as the flock of his people: for they shall be as the
stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land;&rdquo;
Zech. ix. 16.&nbsp; But who are these?&nbsp; Even idolatrous
Ephraim, and backsliding Judah; ver. 13.</p>
<p>I know there is ground to fear, that the iniquity of this
generation will be pursued with heavy judgments: but that will
not hinder what we have supposed.&nbsp; God took him a glorious
church out of bloody Jerusalem, yea, out of the chief of the
sinners there, and left the rest to be taken and spoiled, and
sold, thirty for a penny, in the nations where they were
captives.&nbsp; The gospel working gloriously in a place, to the
seizing upon many of the ringleading sinners thereof, promiseth
no security to the rest, but rather threateneth them with the
heaviest and smartest judgments; as in the instance now given, we
have a full demonstration; but in defending, the Lord will defend
his people; and in saving, he will save his inheritance.</p>
<p>Nor does this speak any great comfort to a decayed and
backsliding sort of Christians; for the next time God rides post
with his gospel, he will leave such Christians behind him.&nbsp;
But I say, Christ is resolved to set up his light in the world;
yea, he is delighted to see his graces shine; and therefore he
commands that his gospel should to that end be offered, in the
first place, to the biggest sinners; for by great sins it shineth
most; therefore he saith, &ldquo;Begin at Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Eighthly</i>, and lastly, Christ Jesus will have mercy to
be offered in the first place to the biggest sinners; for that by
that means the impenitent that are left behind will be at the
judgment the more left without excuse.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s word has two edges; it can cut back-stroke and
fore-stroke: if it doth thee no good, it will do thee hurt; it is
the savour of life unto life to those that receive it, but of
death unto death to them that refuse it; 2 Cor. ii. 15, 16.&nbsp;
But this is not all; the tender of grace to the biggest sinners
in the first place, will not only leave the rest, or those that
refuse it, in a deplorable condition, but will also stop their
mouths, and cut off all pretence to excuse at that day.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If I had not come and spoken unto them,&rdquo; saith
Christ, &ldquo;they had not had sin; but now they have no cloak
for their sin,&rdquo; for their sin of persevering in
impenitence; Job xv. 22.</p>
<p>But what did he speak to them?&nbsp; Why, even that which I
have told you; to wit, That he has in special a delight in saving
the biggest sinners.&nbsp; He spake this in the way of his
doctrine; he spake this in the way of his practice, even to the
pouring out of his last breath before them; Luke xxiii. 34.</p>
<p>Now, since this is so, what can the condemned at the judgment
say for themselves, why sentence of death should not be passed
upon them?&nbsp; I say, what excuse can they make for themselves,
when they shall be asked why they did not in the day of salvation
come to Christ to be saved?&nbsp; Will they have ground to say to
the Lord, Thou wast only for saving of little sinners; and
therefore because they were great ones, they durst not come unto
him? or that thou hadst not compassion for the biggest sinners,
therefore I died in despair?&nbsp; Will these be excuses for
them, as the case now standeth with them?&nbsp; Is there not
every where in God&rsquo;s book a flat contradiction to this, in
multitudes of promises, of invitations, of examples, and the
like?&nbsp; Alas, alas! there will then be there millions of
souls to confute this plea; ready, I say, to stand up, and say,
O! deceived world, heaven swarms with such, as were, when they
were in the world, to the full as bad as you.</p>
<p>Now, this will kill all plea or excuse, why they should perish
in their sins; yea, the text says, they shall see them
there.&nbsp; &ldquo;There shall be weeping, when you shall see
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the
kingdom of heaven, and you yourselves thrust out.&nbsp; And they
shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north,
and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of
God;&rdquo; Luke xiii. 28, 29.&nbsp; Out of which company it is
easy to pick such as sometimes were as bad people as any that now
breathe on the face of the earth.&nbsp; What think you of the
first man, by whose sins there are millions now in hell?&nbsp;
And so I may say, What think you of ten thousand more
besides?</p>
<p>But if the world will not stifle and gag them up (I speak now
for amplification&rsquo;s sake), the view of those who are saved
shall.</p>
<p>There comes an incestuous person to the bar, and pleads, That
the bigness of his sins was a bar to his receiving the
promise.&nbsp; But will not his mouth be stopped as to that, when
Lot and the incestuous Corinthian shall be set before him; Gen.
xix. 33&ndash;37; 1 Cor. v. 1, 2.</p>
<p>There comes a thief, and says, Lord, my sin of theft, I
thought, was such as could not be pardoned by thee!&nbsp; But
when he shall see the thief that was saved on the cross stand by,
as clothed with beauteous glory, what further can he be able to
object?&nbsp; Yea, the Lord will produce ten thousand of his
saints at his coming, who shall after this manner execute
judgment upon all, and so convince all that are ungodly among
them, of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have
spoken against him.&nbsp; And these are hard speeches against
him, to say that he was not able or willing to save men, because
of the greatness of their sins, or to say that they were
discouraged by his word from repentance, because of the
heinousness of their offences.</p>
<p>These things, I say, shall then be confuted: he comes with ten
thousand of his saints to confute them, and to stop their mouths
from making objections against their own eternal damnation.</p>
<p>Here is Adam, the destroyer of the world; here is Lot, that
lay with both his daughters; here is Abraham, that was sometime
an idolater, and Jacob, that was a supplanter, and Reuben, that
lay with his father&rsquo;s concubine, and Judah that lay with
his daughter-in-law, and Levi and Simeon that wickedly slew thee
Shechemites, and Aaron that great backslider, and Manassah that
man of blood and that made an idol to be worshipped, and that
proclaimed a religious feast unto it.&nbsp; Here is also Rachab
the harlot, and Bathsheba that bare a bastard to David.&nbsp;
Here is Solomon a witch.&nbsp; Time would fail me to tell you of
the woman of Canaan&rsquo;s daughter, Magdalen, of Matthew the
publican, and of Gideon and Sampson, and many thousands more.</p>
<p>Alas! alas!&nbsp; I say, what will these sinners do, that
have, through their unbelief, eclipsed the glorious largeness of
the mercy of God, and gave way to despair of salvation, because
of the bigness of their sins?</p>
<p>For all these, though now glorious saints in light, were
sometimes sinners of the biggest size, who had sins that were of
a notorious hue; yet now, I say, they are in their shining and
heavenly robes before the throne of God and of the Lamb, blessing
for ever and ever that Son of God for their salvation, who died
for them upon the tree; admiring that ever it should come into
their hearts once to think of coming to God by Christ; but above
all, blessing God for granting of them light to see those
encouragements in his testament; without which, without doubt,
they had been daunted and sunk down under guilt of sin and
despair, as their fellow-sinners have done.</p>
<p>But now they also are witnesses for God, and for his grace
against an unbelieving world; for, as I said, they shall come to
convince the world of their speeches, their hard and unbelieving
words, that they have spoken concerning the mercy of God, and the
merits of the passion of his blessed Son Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>But will it not, think you, strangely put to silence all such
thoughts, and words, and reasonings of the ungodly before the bar
of God?&nbsp; Doubtless it will; yea and will send them away from
his presence also, with the greatest guilt that possibly can
fasten upon the consciences of men.</p>
<p>For what will sting like this?&mdash;I have, through mine own
foolish, narrow, unworthy, undervaluing thoughts, of the love and
ability of Christ to save me, brought myself to everlasting
ruin.&nbsp; It is true, I was a horrible sinner; not one in a
hundred did live so vile a life as I: but this should not have
kept me from closing with Jesus Christ: I see now that there are
abundance in glory that once were as bad as I have been: but they
were saved by faith, and I am damned by unbelief.</p>
<p>Wretch that I am! why did not I give glory to the redeeming
blood of Jesus?&nbsp; Why did I not humbly cast my soul at his
blessed footstool for mercy?&nbsp; Why did I judge of his ability
to save me by the voice of my shallow reason, and the voice of a
guilty conscience?&nbsp; Why betook not I myself to the holy word
of God?&nbsp; Why did I not read and pray that I might
understand, since now I perceive that God said then, he giveth
liberally to them that pray, and upbraideth not; Jam. i. 5.</p>
<p>It is rational to think, that by such cogitations as these the
unbelieving world will be torn in pieces before the judgment of
Christ; especially those that have lived where they did or might
have heard the gospel of the grace of God.&nbsp; Oh! that saying,
&ldquo;It shall be more tolerable for Sodom at the judgment than
for them,&rdquo; will be better understood.&nbsp; See Luke x.
8&ndash;12.</p>
<p>This reason, therefore, standeth fast; namely, that Christ, by
offering mercy in the first place to the biggest sinner now, will
stop all mouths of the impenitent at the day of judgment, and cut
off all excuse that shall be attempted to be made (from the
thoughts of the greatness of their sins) why they came not to
him.</p>
<p>I have often thought of the day of judgment, and how God will
deal with sinners at that day; and I believe it will be managed
with that sweetness, with that equitableness, with that excellent
righteousness, as to every sin, and circumstance, and aggravation
thereof; that men that are damned, before the judgment is over
shall receive such conviction of the righteous judgment of God
upon them, and of their deserts of hell-fire, that they shall in
themselves conclude that there is all the reason in the world
that they should be shut out of heaven, and go to hell-fire:
&ldquo;These shall go away into everlasting punishment;&rdquo;
Matt. xxv. 46.</p>
<p>Only this will tear them, that they have missed of mercy and
glory, and obtained everlasting damnation through their unbelief;
but it will tear but themselves, but their own souls; they will
gnash upon themselves; for in that mercy was offered to the chief
of them in the first place, and yet they were damned for
rejecting of it; they were damned for forsaking what they had a
sort of propriety in; for forsaking their own mercy.</p>
<p>And thus much for the reasons.&nbsp; I will conclude with a
word of application.</p>
<h2>THE APPLICATION.</h2>
<p><i>First</i>, Would Jesus Christ have mercy offered in the
first place to the biggest sinners? then this shews us how to
make a right judgment of the heart of Christ to men.&nbsp; Indeed
we have advantage to guess at the goodness of his heart, by many
things; as by his taking our nature upon him, his dying for us,
his sending his word and ministers to us, and all that we might
be saved.&nbsp; But this of beginning to offer mercy to
Jerusalem, is that which heightens all the rest; for this doth
not only confirm to us, that love was the cause of his dying for
us, but it shews us yet more the depth of that love.&nbsp; He
might have died for us, and yet have extended the benefit of his
death to a few, as one might call them, of the best conditioned
sinners, to those who, though they were weak, and could not but
sin, yet made not a trade of sinning; to those that sinned not
lavishingly.&nbsp; There are in the world, as one may call them,
the moderate sinners; the sinners that mix righteousness with
their pollutions; the sinners that though they be sinners, do
what on their part lies (some that are blind would think so) that
they might be saved.&nbsp; I say, it had been love, great love,
if he had died for none but such, and sent his love to such: but
that he should send out conditions of peace to the biggest of
sinners; yea, that they should be offered to them first of all;
(for so he means when he says, &ldquo;Begin at Jerusalem;&rdquo;)
this is wonderful! this shews his heart to purpose, as also the
heart of God his Father, who sent him to do thus.</p>
<p>There is nothing more incident to men that are awake in their
souls, than to have wrong thoughts of God; thoughts that are
narrow, and that pinch and pen up his mercy to scanty and
beggarly conclusions, and rigid legal conditions; supposing that
it is rude, and an intrenching upon his majesty, to come
ourselves, or to invite others, until we have scraped and washed,
and rubbed off as much of our dirt from us as we think is
convenient, to make us somewhat orderly and handsome in his
sight.&nbsp; Such never knew what these words meant, &ldquo;Begin
at Jerusalem:&rdquo; yea, such in their hearts have compared the
Father and his Son to niggardly rich men, whose money comes from
them like drops of blood.&nbsp; True, says such, God has mercy,
but he is loath to part with it; you must please him well, if you
get any from him; he is not so free as many suppose, nor is he so
willing to save as some pretended gospellers imagine.&nbsp; But I
ask such, if the Father and Son be not unspeakably free to shew
mercy, why was this clause put into our commission to preach the
gospel?&nbsp; Yea, why did he say, &ldquo;Begin at
Jerusalem:&rdquo; for when men, through the weakness of their
wits, have attempted to shew other reasons why they should have
the first proffer of mercy; yet I can prove (by many undeniable
reasons) that they of Jerusalem (to whom the apostles made the
first offer, according as they were commanded) were the biggest
sinners that ever did breathe upon the face of God&rsquo;s earth,
(set the unpardonable sin aside), upon which my doctrine stands
like a rock, that Jesus the Son of God would have mercy in the
first place offered to the biggest sinners: and if this doth not
shew the heart of the Father and the Son to be infinitely free in
bestowing forgiveness of sins, I confess myself mistaken.</p>
<p>Neither is there, set this aside, another argument like it, to
shew us the willingness of Christ to save sinners; for, as was
said before, all the rest of the signs of Christ&rsquo;s
mercifulness might have been limited to sinners that are so and
so qualified; but when he says, &ldquo;Begin at Jerusalem,&rdquo;
the line is stretched out to the utmost: no man can imagine
beyond it; and it is folly here to pinch and pare, to narrow, and
seek to bring it within scanty bounds; for he plainly saith,
&ldquo;Begin at Jerusalem,&rdquo; the biggest sinner is the
biggest sinner; the biggest is the Jerusalem sinner.</p>
<p>It is true, he saith, that repentance and remission of sins
must go together, but yet remission is sent to the chief, the
Jerusalem sinner; nor doth repentance lessen at all the Jerusalem
sinner&rsquo;s crimes; it diminisheth none of his sins, nor
causes that there should be so much as half a one the fewer: it
only puts a stop to the Jerusalem sinner&rsquo;s course, and
makes him willing to be saved freely by grace; and for time to
come to be governed by that blessed word that has brought the
tidings of good things to him.</p>
<p>Besides, no man shews himself willing to be saved that
repenteth not of his deeds; for he that goes on still in his
trespasses, declares that he is resolved to pursue his own
damnation further.</p>
<p>Learn then to judge of the largeness of God&rsquo;s heart, and
of the heart of his Son Jesus Christ, by the word; judge not
thereof by feeling, nor by the reports of thy conscience;
conscience is oftentimes here befooled and made to go quite
beside the word.&nbsp; It was judging without the word that made
David say, I am cast off from God&rsquo;s eyes, and shall perish
one day by the hand of Saul; Psalm xxxi. 22; 1 Sam. xxvii. 1.</p>
<p>The word had told him another thing; namely, that he should be
king in his stead.&nbsp; Our text says also, that Jesus Christ
bids preachers, in their preaching repentance and remission of
sins, begin first at Jerusalem, thereby declaring most truly the
infinite largeness of the merciful heart of God and his Son, to
the sinful children of men.</p>
<p>Judge thou, I say, therefore, of the goodness of the heart of
God and his Son, by this text, and by others of the same import;
so shalt thou not dishonour the grace of God, nor needlessly
fright thyself, nor give away thy faith, nor gratify the devil,
nor lose the benefit of his word.&nbsp; I speak now to weak
believers.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, Would Jesus Christ have mercy offered in the
first place to the biggest sinners, to the Jerusalem sinners?
then, by this also, you must learn to judge of the sufficiency of
the merits of Christ; not that the merits of Christ can be
comprehended, for that they are beyond the conceptions of the
whole world, being called the unsearchable riches of Christ; but
yet they may be apprehended to a considerable degree.&nbsp; Now,
the way to apprehend them most, is, to consider what offers,
after his resurrection, he makes of his grace to sinners; for to
be sure he will not offer beyond the virtue of his merits;
because, as grace is the cause of his merits, so his merits are
the basis and bounds upon and by which his grace stands good, and
is let out to sinners.</p>
<p>Doth he then command that his mercy should be offered in the
first place to the biggest sinners?&nbsp; It declares, that there
is sufficiency in his blood to save the biggest sinners.&nbsp;
The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from all sin.&nbsp; And
again, &ldquo;Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren,
that through this man (this man&rsquo;s merits) is preached unto
you the forgiveness of sins: and by him all that believe are
justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified
by the law of Moses;&rdquo; Acts xiii. 38.</p>
<p>Observe then thy rule to make judgment of the sufficiency of
the blessed merits of thy Saviour.&nbsp; If he had not been able
to have reconciled the biggest sinners to his Father by his
blood, he would not have sent to them, have sent to them in the
first place, the doctrine of remission of sins; for remission of
sins is through faith in his blood.&nbsp; We are justified freely
by the grace of God, through the redemption that is in the blood
of Christ.&nbsp; Upon the square, as I may call it, of the
worthiness of the blood of Christ, grace acts, and offers
forgiveness of sin to men; Eph. i. 7; chap. ii. 13, 14; Col. i.
20&ndash;22.</p>
<p>Hence, therefore, we must gather, that the blood of Christ is
of infinite value, for that he offereth mercy to the biggest of
sinners.&nbsp; Nay, further, since he offereth mercy in the first
place to the biggest sinners, considering also, that this first
act of his is that which the world will take notice of and expect
it should be continued unto thee end.&nbsp; Also it is a
disparagement to a man that seeks his own glory in what he
undertakes, to do that for a sport, which he cannot continue and
hold out in.&nbsp; This is our Lord&rsquo;s own argument,
&ldquo;He began to build,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;but was not
able to finish;&rdquo; Luke xiv. 28.</p>
<p>Shouldst thou hear a man say, I am resolved to be kind to the
poor, and should begin with giving handfuls of guineas, you would
conclude, that either he is wonderful rich, or must straiten his
hand, or will soon be at the bottom of his riches.&nbsp; Why,
this is the case: Christ, at his resurrection, gave it out that
he would be good to the world; and first sends to the biggest
sinners, with an intent to have mercy on them.&nbsp; Now, the
biggest sinners cannot be saved but by abundance of grace; it is
not a little that will save great sinners; Rom. v. 17.&nbsp; And
I say again, since the Lord Jesus mounts thus high at the first,
and sends to the Jerusalem sinners, that they may come first to
partake of his mercy, it follows, that either he has unsearchable
riches of grace and worth in himself, or else he must straiten
his hand, or his grace and merits will be spent before the world
is at an end.&nbsp; But let it be believed, as surely as spoken,
he is still as full as ever.&nbsp; He is not a jot the poorer for
all the forgivenesses that he has given away to great
sinners.&nbsp; Also he is still as free as at first; for he never
yet called back this word, Begin at the Jerusalem sinners.&nbsp;
And, as I said before, since his grace is extended according to
the worth of his merits, I conclude, that there is the same
virtue in his merits to save now, as there was at the very
beginning.</p>
<p>Oh! the riches of the grace of Christ!&nbsp; Oh! the riches of
the blood of Christ!</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>, Would Jesus Christ have mercy offered in the
first place to the biggest sinners, then here is encouragement
for you that think, for wicked hearts and lives, you have not
your fellows in the world, yet to come to him.</p>
<p>There is a people that therefore fear lest they should be
rejected of Jesus Christ, because of the greatness of their sins;
when, as you see here, such are sent to, sent to by Jesus Christ
to come to him for mercy, &ldquo;Begin at Jerusalem.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Never did one thing answer another more fitly in this world, than
this text fitteth such kind of sinners.&nbsp; As face answereth
face in a glass, so this text answereth the necessities of such
sinners.&nbsp; What can a man say more, but that he stands in the
rank of the biggest sinners? let him stretch himself whither he
can, and think of himself to the utmost, he can but conclude
himself to be one of the biggest sinners.&nbsp; And what
then?&nbsp; Why the text meets him in the very face, and saith,
Christ offereth mercy to the biggest sinners, to the very
Jerusalem sinners.&nbsp; What more can be objected?&nbsp; Nay, he
doth not only offer to such his mercy, but to them it is
commanded to be offered in the first place; &ldquo;Begin at
Jerusalem.&rdquo;&nbsp; Preach repentance and remission of sins
among all nations.&nbsp; &ldquo;Begin at Jerusalem.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Is not here encouragement for those that think, for wicked hearts
and lives, they have not their fellows in the world?</p>
<p><i>Object</i>.&nbsp; But I have a heart as hard as a rock.</p>
<p><i>Answ</i>.&nbsp; Well, but this doth but prove thee a bigger
sinner.</p>
<p><i>Object</i>.&nbsp; But my heart continually frets against
the Lord.</p>
<p><i>Answ</i>.&nbsp; Well, this doth but prove thee a bigger
sinner.</p>
<p><i>Object</i>.&nbsp; But I have been desperate in sinful
courses.</p>
<p><i>Answ</i>.&nbsp; Well, stand thou with the number of the
biggest sinners.</p>
<p><i>Object</i>.&nbsp; But my grey head is found in the way of
wickedness.</p>
<p><i>Answ</i>.&nbsp; Well, thou art in the rank of the biggest
sinners.</p>
<p><i>Object</i>.&nbsp; But I have not only a base heart, but I
have lived a debauched life.</p>
<p><i>Answ</i>.&nbsp; Stand thou also among those that are called
the biggest sinners.&nbsp; And what then?&nbsp; Why the text
swoops you all; you cannot object yourselves beyond the
text.&nbsp; It has a particular message to the biggest
sinners.&nbsp; I say, it swoops you all.</p>
<p><i>Object</i>.&nbsp; But I am a reprobate.</p>
<p><i>Answ</i>.&nbsp; Now thou talkest like a fool, and of that
thou understandest not: no sin, but the sin of final impenitence,
can prove a man a reprobate; and I am sure thou hast not arrived
as yet unto that; therefore thou understandest not what thou
sayest, and makest groundless conclusions against thyself.&nbsp;
Say thou art a sinner, and I will hold with thee; say thou art a
great sinner, and I will say so too; yea, say thou art one of the
biggest sinners, and spare not; for the text yet is beyond thee,
is yet betwixt he and thee; &ldquo;Begin at Jerusalem,&rdquo; has
yet a smile upon thee; and thou talkest as if thou wast a
reprobate, and that the greatness of thy sins do prove thee so to
be, when yet they of Jerusalem were not such, whose sins, I dare
say, were such, both for bigness and heineousness, as thou art
incapable of committing beyond them; unless now, after thou hast
received conviction that the Lord Jesus is the only Saviour of
the world, thou shouldst wickedly and despitefully turn thyself
from him, and conclude he is not to be trusted to for life, and
so crucify him for a cheat afresh.&nbsp; This, I must confess,
will bring a man under the black rod, and set him in danger of
eternal damnation; Heb. vi. 6: chap. x. 29.&nbsp; This is
trampling under foot the Son of God, and counting his blood an
unholy thing.&nbsp; This did they of Jerusalem; but they did it
ignorantly in unbelief; and so were yet capable of mercy: but to
do this against professed light, and to stand to it, puts a man
beyond the text indeed; Acts iii. 14&ndash;17; 1 Tim. i. 13.</p>
<p>But I say, what is this to him that would fain be saved by
Christ?&nbsp; His sins did, as to greatness, never yet reach to
the nature of the sins that the sinners intended by the text, had
made themselves guilty of.&nbsp; He that would be saved by
Christ, has an honourable esteem of him; but they of Jerusalem
preferred a murderer before him; but as for him, they cried,
Away, away with him, it is not fit that he should live.&nbsp;
Perhaps thou wilt object, That thyself hast a thousand times
preferred a stinking lust before him: I answer, Be it so; it is
but what is common to men to do; nor doth the Lord Jesus make
such a foolish life a bar to thee, to forbid thy coming to him,
or a bond to his grace, that it might be kept from thee; but
admits of thy repentance, and offereth himself unto thee freely,
as thou standest among the Jerusalem sinners.</p>
<p>Take therefore encouragement, man, mercy is, by the text, held
forth to the biggest sinners; yea, put thyself into the number of
the worst, by reckoning that thou mayst be one of the first, and
mayst not be put off till the biggest sinners are served; for the
biggest sinners are first invited; consequently, if they come,
they are like to be the first that shall be served.&nbsp; It was
so with Jerusalem; Jerusalem sinners were they that were first
invited, and those of them that came first (and there came three
thousand of them the first day they were invited; how many came
afterwards none can tell), they were first served.</p>
<p>Put in thy name, man, among the biggest, lest thou art made to
wait till they are served.&nbsp; You have some men that think
themselves very cunning, because they put up their names in their
prayers among them that feign it, saying, God, I thank thee I am
not so bad as the worst.&nbsp; But believe it, if they be saved
at all, they shall be saved in the last place.&nbsp; The first in
their own eyes shall be served last; and the last or worst shall
be first.&nbsp; The text insinuates it, &ldquo;Begin at
Jerusalem;&rdquo; and reason backs it, for they have most
need.&nbsp; Behold ye, therefore, how God&rsquo;s ways are above
ours; we are for serving the worst last, God is for serving the
worst first.&nbsp; The man at the pool, that to my thinking was
longest in his disease, and most helpless as to his cure, was
first healed; yea, he only was healed; for we read that Christ
healed him, but we read not then that he healed one more
there!&nbsp; John v. 1&ndash;10.</p>
<p>Wherefore, if thou wouldst soonest be served, put in thy name
among the very worst of sinners.&nbsp; Say, when thou art upon
thy knees, Lord, here is a Jerusalem sinner! a sinner of the
biggest size! one whose burden is of the greatest bulk and
heaviest weight! one that cannot stand long without sinking into
hell, without thy supporting hand!&nbsp; &ldquo;Be not thou far
from me, O Lord!&nbsp; O my strength, haste thou to help
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I say, put in thy name with Magdalen, with Manasseh, that thou
mayst fare as the Magdalen and the Manasseh sinners do.&nbsp; The
man in the gospel made the desperate condition of his child an
argument with Christ to haste his cure: &ldquo;Sir, come
down,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;ere my child die;&rdquo; John iv.
49, and Christ regarded his haste, saying, &ldquo;Go thy way; thy
son liveth;&rdquo; ver. 50.&nbsp; Haste requires haste.&nbsp;
David was for speed; &ldquo;Deliver me speedily;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hear me speedily;&rdquo; &ldquo;Answer me speedily;&rdquo;
Psalm xxxi. 2; lxix. 17; cii. 2.&nbsp; But why speedily?&nbsp; I
am in &ldquo;the net;&rdquo; &ldquo;I am in trouble;&rdquo;
&ldquo;My days are consumed like smoke;&rdquo; Psalm xxxi. 4;
lxix. 17; cii. 3.&nbsp; Deep calleth unto deep, necessity calls
for help; great necessity for present help.</p>
<p>Wherefore, I say, be ruled by me in this matter; feign not
thyself another man, if thou hast been a filthy sinner, but go in
thy colours to Jesus Christ, and put thyself among the most vile,
and let him alone to put thee among the children; Jer. iii.
19.&nbsp; Confess all that thou knowest of thyself; I know thou
wilt find it hard work to do thus; especially if thy mind be
legal; but do it, lest thou stay and be deferred with the little
sinners, until the great ones have had their alms.&nbsp; What do
you think David intended when he said, his wounds stunk and were
corrupted, but to hasten God to have mercy upon him, and not to
defer his cure?&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I am
troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day
long.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am feeble and sore broken, by reason
of the disquietness of my heart;&rdquo; Psalm xxxviii.
3&ndash;8.</p>
<p>David knew what he did by all this; he knew that his making
the worst of his case, was the way to speedy help, and that a
feigning and dissembling the matter with God, was the next way to
a demur as to his forgiveness.</p>
<p>I have one thing more to offer for thy encouragement, who
deemest thyself one of the biggest sinners; and that is, thou art
as it were called by thy name, in the first place, to come in for
mercy.&nbsp; Thou man of Jerusalem, hearken to thy call; men do
so in courts of judicature, and presently cry out, Here, Sir; and
then they shoulder and crowd, and say, Pray give way, I am called
into the court.&nbsp; Why, this thy case, thou great, thou
Jerusalem sinner; be of good cheer, he calleth thee; Mark x.
46&ndash;49.&nbsp; Why sitttest thou still? arise: why standest
thou still? come man, thy call should give thee authority to
come.&nbsp; &ldquo;Begin at Jerusalem,&rdquo; is thy call and
authority to come; wherefore up and shoulder it, man; say, Stand
away, devil, Christ calls me; stand away unbelief, Christ calls
me; stand away all ye my discouraging apprehensions, for my
Saviour calls me to him to receive of his mercy.&nbsp; Men will
do thus, as I said, in courts below; and why shouldst not thou
approach thus to the court above?&nbsp; The Jerusalem sinner is
first in thought, first in commission, first in the record of
names; and therefore should give attendance with expectation,
that he is first to receive mercy of God.</p>
<p>Is not this an encouragement to the biggest sinners to make
their application to Christ for mercy? &ldquo;Come unto me all ye
that labour and are heavy laden,&rdquo; doth also confirm this
thing; that is, that the biggest sinner, and he that has the
biggest burden, is he who is first invited.&nbsp; Christ pointeth
over the heads of thousands, as he sits on the throne of grace,
directly to such a man; and says, Bring in hither the maimed, the
halt, and the blind; let the Jerusalem sinner that stands there
behind come to me.&nbsp; Wherefore, since Christ says, Come, to
thee, let thee angels make a lane, and let all men give place,
that the Jerusalem sinner may come to Jesus Christ for mercy.</p>
<p><i>Fourthly</i>, Would Jesus Christ have mercy offered, in the
first place, to the biggest sinners?&nbsp; Then come thou profane
wretch, and let me a little enter into an argument with
thee.&nbsp; Why wilt thou not come to Jesus Christ, since thou
art a Jerusalem sinner?&nbsp; How canst thou find in thy heart to
set thyself against grace, against such grace as offereth mercy
to thee?&nbsp; What spirit possesseth thee, and holds thee back
from a sincere closure with thy Saviour?&nbsp; Behold God
groaningly complains of thee, saying, &ldquo;But Israel would
none of me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;When I called, none did
answer;&rdquo; Psl. lxxxi. 11; Isa. lxvi. 4.</p>
<p>Shall God enter this complaint against thee?&nbsp; Why dost
thou put him off?&nbsp; Why dost thou stop thine ear?&nbsp; Canst
thou defend thyself?&nbsp; When thou art called to an account for
thy neglects of so great salvation, what canst thou answer? or
doest thou think thou shalt escape the judgment?&nbsp; Heb. ii.
3.</p>
<p>No more such Christs!&nbsp; There will be no more such
Christs, sinner!&nbsp; Oh, put not the day, the day of grace,
away from thee! if it be once gone, it will never come again,
sinner.</p>
<p>But what is it that has got thy heart, and that keeps it from
thy Saviour?&nbsp; &ldquo;Who in the heaven can be compared unto
the Lord? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto
the Lord?&rdquo;&nbsp; Psl. lxxxix. 6.&nbsp; Hast thou, thinkest
thou, found anything so good as Jesus Christ?</p>
<p>Is there any among thy sins, thy companions, and foolish
delights, that like Christ can help thee in the day of thy
distress?&nbsp; Behold, the greatness of thy sins cannot hinder;
let not the stubbornness of thy heart hinder thee, sinner.</p>
<p><i>Object</i>.&nbsp; But I am ashamed.</p>
<p><i>Answ</i>.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Do not be ashamed to be saved,
sinner.</p>
<p><i>Object</i>.&nbsp; But my old companions will mock me.</p>
<p><i>Answ</i>.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Do not be mocked out of eternal
life, sinner.</p>
<p>Thy stubbornness affects, afflicts the heart of thy
Saviour.&nbsp; Carest thou not for this?&nbsp; Of old he beheld
the city, and wept over it.&nbsp; Canst thou hear this, and not
be concerned?&nbsp; Luke xix. 41, 42.&nbsp; Shall Christ weep to
see thy soul going on to destruction, and wilt thou sport thyself
in that way?&nbsp; Yea, shall Christ, that can be eternally happy
without thee, be more afflicted at the thoughts of the loss of
thy soul, than thyself, who art certainly eternally miserable if
thou neglectest to come to him.</p>
<p>Those things that keep thee and thy Saviour, on thy part
asunder, are but bubbles; the least prick of an affliction will
let out, as to thee, what now thou thinkest is worth the venture
of heaven to enjoy.</p>
<p>Hast thou not reason?&nbsp; Canst thou not so much as once
soberly think of thy dying hour, or of whither thy sinful life
will drive thee then?&nbsp; Hast thou no conscience? or having
one, is it rocked so fast asleep by sin, or made so weary with an
unsuccessful calling upon thee, that it is laid down, and cares
for thee no more?&nbsp; Poor man! thy state is to be
lamented.&nbsp; Hast no judgment?&nbsp; Art not able to conclude,
that to be saved is better than to burn in hell? and that eternal
life, with God&rsquo;s favour, is better than a temporal life in
God&rsquo;s displeasure?&nbsp; Hast no affection but what is
brutish? what, none at all? no affection for the God that made
thee? what! none for his loving Son that has shewed his love, and
died for thee?&nbsp; Is not heaven worth thy affection?&nbsp; O
poor man! which is strongest thinkest thou, God or thee?&nbsp; If
thou art not able to overcome him, thou art a fool for standing
out against him; Matt. v. 25, 26.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a fearful
thing to fall into the hands of the living God.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
will gripe hard; his fist is stronger than a lion&rsquo;s paw;
take heed of him, he will be angry if you despise his Son; and
will you stand guilty in your trespasses, when he offereth you
his grace and favour?&nbsp; Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7; Heb. x.
29&ndash;31.</p>
<p>Now we come to the text, &ldquo;Beginning at
Jerusalem.&rdquo;&nbsp; This text, though it be now one of the
brightest stars that shineth in the Bible, because there is in
it, as full, if not the fullest offer of grace that can be
imagined, to the sons of men; yet to them that shall perish from
under this word, even this text will be to such, one of the
hottest coals in hell.</p>
<p>This text, therefore, will save thee or sink thee: there is no
shifting of it: if it saves thee, it will set thee high; if it
sinks thee, it will set thee low.</p>
<p>But, I say, why so unconcerned?&nbsp; Hast no soul? or dost
think thou mayst lose thy soul, and save thyself?&nbsp; Is it not
pity, had it otherwise been the will of God, that ever thou wast
made a man, for that thou settest so little by thy soul?</p>
<p>Sinner, take the invitation; thou art called upon to come to
Christ: nor art thou called upon but by order from the Son of God
though thou shouldst happen to come of the biggest sinners; for
he has bid us offer mercy, as to all the world in general, so, in
the first place, to the sinners of Jerusalem, or to the biggest
sinners.</p>
<p><i>Fifthly</i>, Would Jesus Christ have mercy offered in thee
first place, to the biggest sinners? then this shews how
unreasonable a thing it is for men to despair of mercy: for those
that presume, I shall say something to them afterward.</p>
<p>I now speak to them that despair.</p>
<p>There are four sorts of despair.&nbsp; There is the despair of
devils; there is the despair of souls in hell; there is the
despair that is grounded upon men&rsquo;s deficiency; and there
is the despair that they are perplexed with that are willing to
be saved, but are too strongly borne down with the burthen of
their sins.</p>
<p>The despair of devils, the damned&rsquo;s despair, and that
despair that a man has of attaining of life because of his own
deficiency, are all unreasonable.&nbsp; Why should not devils and
damned souls despair? yea, why should not man despair of getting
to heaven by his own abilities?&nbsp; I therefore am concerned
only with the fourth sort of despair, to wit, with the despair of
those that would be saved, but are too strongly borne down with
the burden of their sins.</p>
<p>I say, therefore, to thee that art thus, And why
despair?&nbsp; Thy despair, if it were reasonable, should flow
from thee, because found in the land that is beyond the grave, or
because thou certainly knowest that Christ will not, or cannot
save thee.</p>
<p>But for the first, thou art yet in the land of the living; and
for the second, thou hast ground to believe the quite contrary;
Christ is able to save to the uttermost them that come to God by
him; and if he were not willing, he would not have commanded that
mercy, in the first place, should be offered to the biggest
sinners.&nbsp; Besides, he hath said, &ldquo;And let him that is
athirst come, and whosoever will, let him take the water of life
freely;&rdquo; that is, with all my heart.&nbsp; What ground now
is here for despair?&nbsp; If thou sayst, The number and burden
of my sins; I answer, Nay; that is rather a ground for faith:
because such an one, above all others, is invited by Christ to
come unto him, yea, promised rest and forgiveness if they come;
Matt. xi. 28.&nbsp; What ground then to despair?&nbsp; Verily
none at all.&nbsp; Thy despair then is a thing unreasonable and
without footing in the word.</p>
<p>But I have no experience of God&rsquo;s love; God hath given
me no comfort, or ground of hope, though I have waited upon him
for it many a day.</p>
<p>Thou hast experience of God&rsquo;s love, for that he has
opened thine eyes to see thy sins: and for that he has given thee
desires to be saved by Jesus Christ.&nbsp; For by thy sense of
sin thou art made to see thy poverty of spirit, and that has laid
thee under a sure ground to hope that heaven shall be thine
hereafter.</p>
<p>Also thy desires to be saved by Christ, has put thee under
another promise, so there is two to hold thee up in them, though
thy present burden be never so heavy, Matt. v. 3, 6.&nbsp; As for
what thou sayst, as to God&rsquo;s silence to thee, perhaps he
has spoken to thee once or twice already, but thou hast not
perceived it; Job xxxiii. 14, 15.</p>
<p>However, thou hast Christ crucified, set forth before thine
eyes in the Bible, and an invitation to come unto him, though
thou be a Jerusalem sinner, though thou be the biggest sinner;
and so no ground to despair.&nbsp; What, if God will be silent to
thee, is that ground of despair?&nbsp; Not at all, so long as
there is a promise in the Bible that God will in no wise cast
away the coming sinner, and so long as he invites the Jerusalem
sinner to come unto him John vi. 37.</p>
<p>Build not therefore despair upon these things; they are no
sufficient foundations for it, such plenty of promises being in
the Bible, and such a discovery of his mercy to great sinners of
old; especially since we have withal a clause in the commission
given to ministers to preach, that they should begin with the
Jerusalem sinners in their offering of mercy to the world.</p>
<p>Besides, God says, They that wait upon the Lord shall renew
their strength, they shall mount up with wings like eagles; but
perhaps it may be long first.&nbsp; &ldquo;I waited long,&rdquo;
saith David, &ldquo;and did seek the Lord;&rdquo; and at length
his cry was heard: wherefore he bids his soul wait on God, and
says, For it is good so to do before thy saints; Psalm xl. 1;
lxii. 5; lii. 9.</p>
<p>And what if thou waitest upon God all thy days?&nbsp; Is it
below thee?&nbsp; And what if God will cross his book, and blot
out the hand-writing that is against thee, and not let thee know
it as yet?&nbsp; Is it fit to say unto God, Thou art
hard-hearted?&nbsp; Despair not; thou hast no ground to despair,
so long as thou livest in this world.&nbsp; It is a sin to begin
to despair before one sets his foot over the threshold of
hell-gates.&nbsp; For them that are there, let them despair and
spare not; but as for thee, thou hast no ground to do it.&nbsp;
What! despair of bread in a land that is full of corn! despair of
mercy when our God is full of mercy! despair of mercy, when God
goes about by his ministers, beseeching of sinners to be
reconciled unto him!&nbsp; 2 Cor. v. 18&ndash;20.</p>
<p>Thou scrupulous fool, where canst thou find that God was ever
false to his promise, or that he ever deceived the soul that
ventured itself upon him?&nbsp; He often calls upon sinners to
trust him, though they walk in darkness, and have no light; Isa.
1. 10.</p>
<p>They have his promise and oath for their salvation, that flee
for refuge to the hope set before them; Heb. vi. 17, 18.</p>
<p>Despair! when we have a God of mercy, and a redeeming Christ
alive!&nbsp; For shame, forbear: let them despair that dwell
where there is no God, and that are confined to those chambers of
death which can be reached by no redemption.</p>
<p>A living man despair when he is chid for murmuring and
complaining!&nbsp; Lam. iii. 39.&nbsp; Oh! so long as we are
where promises swarm, where mercy is proclaimed, where grace
reigns, and where Jerusalem sinners are privileged with the first
offer of mercy, it is a base thing to despair.</p>
<p>Despair undervalues the promise, undervalues the invitation,
undervalues the proffer of grace.&nbsp; Despair undervalues the
ability of God the Father, and the redeeming blood of Christ his
Son.&nbsp; Oh unreasonable despair!</p>
<p>Despair makes man God&rsquo;s judge; it is a controller of the
promise, a contradicter of Christ in his large offers of mercy:
and one that undertakes to make unbelief the great manager of our
reason and judgment, in determining about what God can and will
do for sinners.</p>
<p>Despair!&nbsp; It is the devil&rsquo;s fellow, the
devil&rsquo;s master; yea, the chains with which he is captivated
and held under darkness for ever: and to give way thereto in a
land, in a state and time that flows with milk and honey, is an
uncomely thing.</p>
<p>I would say to my soul, O my soul! this is not the place of
despair; this is not the time to despair in: as long as mine eyes
can find a promise in the Bible, as long as there is the least
mention of grace, as long as there is a moment left me of breath
or life in this world; so long will I wait or look for mercy, so
long will I fight against unbelief and despair.</p>
<p>This is the way to honour God and Christ; this is the way to
set the crown on the promise; this is the way to welcome the
invitation and inviter; and this is the way to thrust thyself
under the shelter and protection of the word of grace.&nbsp;
Never despair so long as our text is alive, for that doth sound
it out,&mdash;that mercy by Christ is offered, in the first
place, to the biggest sinner.</p>
<p>Despair is an unprofitable thing; it will make a man weary of
waiting upon God; 2 Kings vi. 33; it will make a man forsake God,
and seek his heaven in the good things of this world; Gen. iv.
13&ndash;18.&nbsp; It will make a man his own tormentor, and
flounce and fling like a wild bull in a net; Isa. ii. 20.</p>
<p>Despair! it drives a man to the study of his own ruin, and
brings him at last to be his own executioner; 2 Sam. xvii. 23;
Matt. xxvii. 3&ndash;5.</p>
<p>Besides, I am persuaded also, that despair is the cause that
there are so many that would fain be Atheists in the world: For
because they have entertained a conceit that God will never be
merciful to them; therefore they labour to persuade themselves
that there is no God at all, as if their misbelief would kill
God, or cause him to cease to be.&nbsp; A poor shift for an
immortal soul, for a soul who liketh not to retain God in its
knowledge!&nbsp; If this be the best that despair can do, let it
go, man, and betake thyself to faith, to prayer, to wait for God,
and to hope, in despite of ten thousand doubts.&nbsp; And for thy
encouragement, take yet (as an addition to what has already been
said) the following scripture; &ldquo;The Lord taketh pleasure in
them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy;&rdquo; Psal.
cxlvii. 11.</p>
<p>Whence note, They fear not God, that hope not in his mercy:
also God is angry with them that hope not in his mercy: for he
only taketh pleasure in them that hope.&nbsp; He that believeth,
or hath received his testimony, &ldquo;hath set to his seal that
God is true,&rdquo; John iii. 33; but he that receiveth it not
hath made him a liar, and that is a very unworthy thing; 1 John
v. 10, 11.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let the wicked forsake his ways, and the
unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to the Lord, and
he will have mercy on him; and to our God, for he will abundantly
multiply pardons.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps thou art weary of thy
ways, but art not weary of thy thoughts, of thy unbelieving and
despairing thoughts; now, God also would have thee cast away
these thoughts, as such which he deserveth not at thy hands; for
he will have mercy upon thee, and he will abundantly pardon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the
prophets have spoken!&rdquo; Luke xxiv. 25.&nbsp; Mark you here,
slowness to believe is a piece of folly.&nbsp; Ay! but sayst
thou, I do believe some, and I believe what can make against
me.&nbsp; Ay, but sinner, Christ Jesus here calls thee fool for
not believing all.&nbsp; Believe all, and despair if thou
canst.&nbsp; He that believes all, believes that text that saith,
Christ would have mercy preached first to the Jerusalem
sinners.&nbsp; He that believeth all, believeth all the promises
and consolations of the word; and the promises and consolations
of the word weigh heavier than do all the curses and threatenings
of the law; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.&nbsp; Wherefore
believe all, and mercy will to thy conscience weigh judgment
down, and so minister comfort to thy soul.&nbsp; The Lord take
the yoke from off thy jaws, since he has set meat before thee;
Hos. xi. 4; and help thee to remember that he is pleased in the
first place to offer mercy to the biggest sinners.</p>
<p><i>Sixthly</i>, Since Jesus Christ would have mercy offered in
the first place to the biggest sinners, let souls see that they
lay right hold thereof, lest they, notwithstanding, indeed come
short thereof.&nbsp; Faith only knows how to deal with mercy;
wherefore put not in the place thereof presumption.&nbsp; I have
observed, that as there are herbs and flowers in our gardens, so
there are their counterfeits in the field; only they are
distinguished from the other by the name of wild ones.&nbsp; Why,
there is faith, and wild faith; and wild faith is this
presumption.&nbsp; I call it wild faith, because God never placed
it in his garden, his church; it is only to be found in the
field, the world.&nbsp; I also call it wild faith, because it
only grows up and is nourished where other wild notions
abound.&nbsp; Wherefore take heed of this, and all may be well;
for this presumuptuousness is a very heinous thing in the eyes of
God: &ldquo;The soul,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;that doeth ought
presumptuously (whether he be born in the land, or a stranger),
the same reproacheth the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off
from among his people;&rdquo; Numb. xv. 30.</p>
<p>The thoughts of this made David tremble, and pray that God
would hold him back from presumptuous sins, and not suffer them
to have dominion over him; Psal. xix. 13.</p>
<p>Now this presumption, then, puts itself in the place of faith,
when it tampereth with the promise for life, while the soul is a
stranger to repentance.&nbsp; Wherefore you have in the text, to
prevent doing thus, both repentance and remission of sins to be
offered to Jerusalem; not remission without repentance: for all
that repent not shall perish, let them presume on grace and the
promise while they will; Luke xiii. 1&ndash;3.</p>
<p>Presumption, then, is that which severeth faith and
repentance, concluding, that the soul shall be saved by grace,
though the man was never made sorry for his sins, nor the love of
the heart turned therefrom.&nbsp; This is to be self-willed, as
Peter has it; and this is a despising the word of the Lord, for
that has put repentance and faith together; Mark i. 15.&nbsp; And
&ldquo;because he hath despised the word of the Lord, and hath
broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off: his
iniquity shall be upon him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Numb. xv. 31.</p>
<p>Let such therefore look to it, who yet are, and abide in their
sins; for such, if they hope, as they are, to be saved, presume
upon the grace of God.&nbsp; Wherefore presumption and not
hearkening to God&rsquo;s word are put together; Deut. xvii.
12.</p>
<p>Again, Then men presume when they are resolved to abide in
their sins, and yet expect to be saved by God&rsquo;s grace
through Christ.&nbsp; This is as much as to say, God liketh sin
as well as I do, and careth not how men live, if so be they lean
upon his Son.&nbsp; Of this sort are they that build up Zion with
blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity; that judge for reward, and
teach for hire, and divine for money, and lean upon the Lord;
Mic. iii. 10, 11.&nbsp; This is doing things with an high hand
against the Lord our God, and a taking him, as it were, at the
catch.&nbsp; This is, as we say among men, to seek to put a trick
upon God, as if he had not sufficiently fortified his proposals
of grace by his holy word, against all such kind of fools as
these.&nbsp; But look to it.</p>
<p>Such will be found at the day of God, not among that great
company of Jerusalem sinners that shall be saved by grace, but
among those that have been the great abusers of the grace of God
in the world.&nbsp; Those that say, Let us sin that grace may
abound, and let us do evil that good may come, their damnation is
just.&nbsp; And if so, they are a great way off of that salvation
that is by Jesus Christ presented to the Jerusalem sinners.</p>
<p>I have therefore these things to propound to that Jerusalem
sinner that would know, if he may be so bold as to venture
himself upon this grace.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, Dost thou see thy sins?</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, Art thou weary of them?</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>, Wouldst thou with all thy heart be saved by
Jesus Christ?&nbsp; I dare say no less, I dare say no more.&nbsp;
But if it be truly thus with thee, how great soever thy sins have
been, how bad soever thou feelest thy heart, how far soever thou
art from thinking that God has mercy for these: thou art the man,
the Jerusalem sinner, that the Word of God has conquered, and to
whom it offereth free remission of sins, by the redemption that
is in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>When the jailor cried out, &ldquo;Sirs, What must I do to be
saved?&rdquo;&nbsp; The answer was, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord
Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.&rdquo;&nbsp; He that sees
his sins aright, is brought to his wit&rsquo;s end by them; and
he that is so, is willing to part from them, and to be saved by
the grace of God.</p>
<p>If this be thy case, fear not, give no way to despair; thou
presumest not, if thou believest to life everlasting in Jesus
Christ: yea, Christ is prepared for such as thou art.</p>
<p>Therefore take good courage and believe.&nbsp; The design of
Satan is to tell the presumptuous, that their presuming on mercy
is good; but to persuade the believer, that his believing is
impudent bold dealing with God.&nbsp; I never heard a
presumptuous man in my life say that he was afraid that he
presumed; but I have heard many an honest humble soul say, that
they have been afraid that their faith has been
presumption.&nbsp; Why should Satan molest those whose ways he
knows will bring them to him?&nbsp; And who can think that he
should be quiet when men take the right course to escape his
hellish snares?&nbsp; This, therefore, is the reason why the
truly humbled is opposed, while the presumptuous goes on by wind
and tide.&nbsp; The truly humble Satan hates, but he laughs to
see the foolery of the other.</p>
<p>Does thy hand and heart tremble?&nbsp; Upon thee the promise
smiles.&nbsp; &ldquo;To this man will I look,&rdquo; says God,
&ldquo;even to him that is poor, and of a contrite spirit, and
trembles at my word;&rdquo; Isa. lxvi. 2.</p>
<p>What, therefore, I have said of presumption concerns not the
humble in spirit at all.&nbsp; I therefore am for gathering up
the stones, and for taking the stumblingblocks out of the way of
God&rsquo;s people: and forewarning of them that lay the
stumblingblock of their iniquity before their faces, and that are
for presuming upon God&rsquo;s mercy; and let them look to
themselves; Ezek. xiv. 6&ndash;8.</p>
<p>Also our text stands firm as ever it did, and our observation
is still of force, that Jesus Christ would have mercy offered in
the first place to the biggest sinners.&nbsp; So then let none
despair, let none presume; let none despair that are sorry for
their sins, and would be saved by Jesus Christ; let none presume
that abide in the liking of their sins, though they seem to know
the exceeding grace of Christ; for though the door stands wide
open for the reception of the penitent, yet it is fast enough
barred and bolted against the presumptuous sinner.&nbsp; Be not
deceived, God is not mocked, whatsoever a man sows, that he shall
reap.&nbsp; It cannot be that God should be wheedled out of his
mercy, or prevailed upon by lips of dissimulation; he knows them
that trust in him, and that sincerely come to him by Christ for
mercy; Nahum i. 7.</p>
<p>It is then not the abundance of sins committed, but the not
coming heartily to God by Christ for mercy, that shuts men out of
doors.&nbsp; And though their not coming heartily may be said to
be but a sin, yet it is such a sin as causeth that all thy other
sins abide upon thee unforgiven.</p>
<p>God complains of this.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have not cried unto
me with their heart; they turned, but not to the most High.&nbsp;
They turned feignedly;&rdquo; Jer. iii. 10; Hos. vii. 14, 16.</p>
<p>Thus doing, his soul hates; but the penitent, humble,
brokenhearted sinner, be his transgressions red as scarlet, red
like crimson, in number as the sand; though his transgressions
cry to heaven against him for vengeance, and seem there to cry
louder than do his prayers, or tears, or groans for mercy, yet he
is safe.&nbsp; To this man God will look; Isa. i. 18; chap lxvi.
2.</p>
<p><i>Seventhly</i>, Would Jesus Christ have mercy offered in the
first place to the biggest sinners?&nbsp; Then here is ground for
those that, as to practice, have not been such, to come to him
for mercy.</p>
<p>Although there is no sin little of itself; because it is a
contradiction of the nature and majesty of God; yet we must admit
of divers numbers, and also of aggravations.&nbsp; Two sins are
not so many as three; nor are three that are done in ignorance so
big as one that is done against light, against knowledge and
conscience.&nbsp; Also there is the child in sin, and a man in
sin that has his hairs gray, and his skin wrinkled for very
age.&nbsp; And we must put a difference betwixt these sinners
also.&nbsp; For can it be that a child of seven, or ten, or
sixteen years old, should be such a sinner&mdash;a sinner so vile
in the eye of the law as he is who has walked according to the
course of this world, forty, fifty, sixty, or seventy
years?&nbsp; Now the youth, this stripling, though he is a
sinner, is but a little sinner, when compared with such.</p>
<p>Now, I say, if there be room for the first sort, for those of
the biggest size, certainly there is room for the lesser
size?&nbsp; If there be a door wide enough for a giant to go in
at, there is certainly room for a dwarf.&nbsp; If Christ Jesus
has grace enough to save great sinners, he has surely grace
enough to save little ones.&nbsp; If he can forgive five hundred
pence, for certain he can forgive fifty; Luke vii. 41, 42.</p>
<p>But you said before, that the little sinners must stand by
until the great ones have received their grace, and that is
discouraging!</p>
<p>I answer, there are two sorts of little sinners, such as are
so, and such as feign themselves so.&nbsp; They are those that
feign themselves so, that I intended there, and not those that
are indeed comparatively so.&nbsp; Such as feign themselves so
may wait long enough before they obtain forgiveness.</p>
<p>But again, a sinner may be comparatively a little sinner, and
sensibly a great one.&nbsp; There are then two sorts of greatness
in sin; greatness by reason of number; greatness by reason of
thoroughness of conviction of the horrible nature of sin.&nbsp;
In this last sense, he that has but one sin, if such a one could
be found, may in his own eyes find himself the biggest sinner in
the world.&nbsp; Let this man or this child therefore put himself
among the great sinners, and plead with God as great sinners do,
and expect to be saved with the great sinners, and as soon and as
heartily as they.</p>
<p>Yea, a little sinner, that comparatively is truly so, if he
shall graciously give way to conviction, and shall in God&rsquo;s
light diligently weigh the horrible nature of his own sins, may
yet sooner obtain forgiveness for them at the hands of the
heavenly Father, than he that has ten times his sins, and so
cause to cry ten times harder to God for mercy.</p>
<p>For the grievousness of the cry is a great thing with God; for
if he will hear the widow, if she cries at all, how much more if
she cries most grievously?&nbsp; Exod. xxii. 22, 23.</p>
<p>It is not the number, but the true sense of the abominable
nature of sin, that makes the cry for pardon lamentable.&nbsp;
He, as I said, that has many sins, may not cry so loud in the
ears of God as he that has far fewer; he, in our present sense,
that is in his own eyes the biggest sinner, is he that soonest
findeth mercy.</p>
<p>The offer then is to the biggest sinner; to the biggest sinner
first, and the mercy is first obtained by him that first
confesseth himself to be such an one.</p>
<p>There are men that strive at the throne of grace for mercy, by
pleading the greatness of their necessity.&nbsp; Now their plea,
as to the prevalency of it, lieth not in the counting up of the
number, but in the sense of the greatness of their sins, and in
the vehemency of their cry for pardon.&nbsp; And it is
observable, that though the birthright was Ruben&rsquo;s, and,
for his foolishness, given to the sons of Joseph, yet Judah
prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the Messias; 1
Chron. v. 1, 2.</p>
<p>There is a heavenly subtilty to be managed in this
matter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath
taken away thy blessing.&rdquo;&nbsp; The blessing belonged to
Esau, but Jacob by his diligence made it his own; Gen. xxvii.
33.&nbsp; The offer is to the biggest sinner, to the biggest
sinner first; but if he forbear to cry, the sinner that is a
sinner less by far than he, both as to number and the nature of
transgression, may get the blessing first, if he shall have grace
to bestir himself well; for the loudest cry is heard furthest,
and the most lamentable pierces soonest.</p>
<p>I therefore urge this head, not because I would have little
sinners go and tell God that they are little sinners, thereby to
think to obtain mercy; for, verily, so they are never like to
have it: for such words declare, that such a one hath no true
sense at all of the nature of his sins.</p>
<p>Sin, as I said, in the nature of it, is horrible, though it be
but one single sin as to act; yea, though it be but a sinful
thought; and so worthily calls for the damnation of the soul.</p>
<p>The comparison, then, of little and great sinners, is to go
for good sense among men.&nbsp; But to plead the fewness of thy
sins, or the comparative harmlessness of their quantity before
God, argueth no sound knowledge of the nature of thy sin, and so
no true sense of the nature or need of mercy.</p>
<p>Little sinner, when therefore thou goest to God, though thou
knowest in thy conscience that thou, as to acts, art no thief, no
murderer, no whore, no liar, no false swearer, or the like, and
in reason must needs understand that thus thou art not so
profanely vile as others; yet when thou goest to God for mercy,
know no man&rsquo;s sins but thine own, make mention of no
man&rsquo;s sins but thine own.&nbsp; Also labour not to lessen
thy own, but magnify and greaten them by all just circumstances,
and be as if there was never a sinner in the world but
thyself.&nbsp; Also cry out, as if thou wast the only undone man;
and that is the way to obtain God&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<p>It is one of the comeliest sights in the world to see a little
sinner commenting upon the greatness of his sins, multiplying and
multiplying them to himself, till he makes them in his own eyes
bigger and higher than he seeth any other man&rsquo;s sins to be
in the world; and as base a thing it is to see a man do
otherwise, and as basely will come on it; Luke xviii.
10&ndash;14.</p>
<p>As, therefore, I said to the great sinner before, let him take
heed lest he presume; I say now to the little sinner, let him
take heed that he do not dissemble: for there is as great an
aptness in the little sinner to dissemble, as there is in the
great one.&nbsp; &ldquo;He that hideth his sins shall not
prosper,&rdquo; be he a sinner little or great; Prov. xxviii.
13.</p>
<p><i>Eighthly</i>, Would Jesus Christ have mercy offered, in the
first place, to the biggest sinners?&nbsp; Then this shews the
true cause why Satan makes such head as he doth against him.</p>
<p>The Father and the Holy Spirit are well spoken of by all
deluders and deceived persons; Christ only is the rock of
offence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold I lay in Zion a stumbling-stone and
a rock of offence;&rdquo; Rom. ix. 33.&nbsp; Not that Satan
careth for the Father or the Spirit more than he careth for the
Son, but he can let men alone with their notions of the Father
and the Spirit, for he knows they shall never enjoy the Father
nor the Spirit, if indeed they receive not the merits of the
Son.&nbsp; &ldquo;He that hath the Son, hath life; he that hath
not the Son of God hath not life,&rdquo; however they may boast
themselves of the Father and the Spirit; 1 John v. 12.&nbsp;
Again, &ldquo;Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the
doctrine of Christ, hath not God: he that abideth in the doctrine
of Christ, hath both the Father and the Son;&rdquo; 2 John i.
9.</p>
<p>Christ, and Christ only, is he that can make us capable to
enjoy God with life and joy to all eternity.&nbsp; Hence he calls
himself the way to the Father, the true and living way; John xiv.
6; Heb. x. 19, 20; for we cannot come to the Father but by
him.&nbsp; Satan knows this, therefore he hates him.&nbsp;
Deluded persons are ignorant of this, and, therefore, they are so
led up and down by Satan by the nose as they are.</p>
<p>There are many things by which Satan has taken occasion to
greaten his rage against Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>As, first, his love to man, and then the many expressions of
that love.&nbsp; He hath taken man&rsquo;s nature upon him; he
hath in that nature fulfilled the law to bring in righteousness
for man; and hath spilt his blood for the reconciling of men to
God; he hath broke the neck of death, put away sin, destroyed the
works of the devil, and got into his own hands the keys of death:
and all these are heinous things to Satan.&nbsp; He cannot abide
Christ for this.&nbsp; Besides, he hath eternal life in himself;
and that to bestow upon us; and we in all likelihood are to
possess the very places from which the Satans by transgression
fell, if not places more glorious.&nbsp; Wherefore he must needs
be angry.&nbsp; And is it not a vexatious thing to him, that we
should be admitted to the throne of grace by Christ, while he
stands bound over in chains of darkness, to answer for his
rebellions against God and his Son, at the terrible day of
judgment.&nbsp; Yea, we poor dust and ashes must become his
judges, and triumph over him for ever: and all this long of Jesus
Christ; for he is the meritorious cause of all this.</p>
<p>Now though Satan seeks to be revenged for this, yet he knows
it is in vain to attack the person of Christ; he has overcome
him: therefore he tampers with a company of silly men, that he
may vilify him by them.&nbsp; And they, bold fools as they are,
will not spare to spit in his face.&nbsp; They will rail at his
person, and deny the very being of it; they will rail at his
blood, and deny the merit and worth of it.&nbsp; They will deny
the very end why he accomplished the law, and by jiggs, and
tricks, and quirks, which he helpeth them to, they set up fond
names and images in his place, and give the glory of a Saviour to
them.&nbsp; Thus Satan worketh under the name of Christ; and his
ministers under the name of the ministers of righteousness.</p>
<p>And by his wiles and stratagems he undoes a world of men; but
there is a seed, and they shall serve him, and it shall be
counted to the Lord for a generation.&nbsp; These shall see their
sins, and that Christ is the way to happiness.&nbsp; These shall
venture themselves, both body and soul, upon his worthiness.</p>
<p>All this Satan knows, and therefore his rage is kindled the
more.&nbsp; Wherefore, according to his ability and allowance, he
assaulteth, tempteth, abuseth, and stirs up what he can to be
hurtful to these poor people, that he may, while his time shall
last, make it as hard and difficult for them to go to eternal
glory as he can.&nbsp; Oftentimes he abuses them with wrong
apprehensions of God, and with wrong apprehensions of
Christ.&nbsp; He also casts them into the mire, to the reproach
of religion, the shame of their brethren, the derision of the
world, and dishonour of God.</p>
<p>He holds our hands while the world buffets us; he puts
bear-skins upon us, and then sets the dogs at us.&nbsp; He
bedaubeth us with his own foam, and then tempts us to believe
that that bedaubing comes from ourselves.</p>
<p>Oh! the rage and the roaring of this lion, and the hatred that
he manifests against the Lord Jesus, and against them that are
purchased with his blood!&nbsp; But yet, in the midst of all
this, the Lord Jesus sends forth his herald to proclaim in the
nations his love to the world, and to invite them to come in to
him for life.&nbsp; Yea, his invitation is so large, that it
offereth his mercy in the first place to the biggest sinners of
every age, which augments the devil&rsquo;s rage the more.</p>
<p>Wherefore, as I said before, fret he, fume he, the Lord Jesus
will divide the spoil with this great one; yea, he shall divide
the spoil with the strong, because he hath poured out his soul
unto death, and he was numbered with the transgressors, and he
bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the
transgressors; Isa. liii. 12.</p>
<p><i>Ninthly</i>, Would Jesus Christ have mercy offered in the
first place to the biggest sinners?&nbsp; Let the tempted harp
upon this string for their help and consolation.&nbsp; The
tempted wherever he dwells, always thinks himself the biggest
sinner, one most unworthy of eternal life.</p>
<p>This is Satan&rsquo;s master-argument: thou art a horrible
sinner, a hypocrite, one that has a profane heart, and one that
is an utter stranger to a work of grace.&nbsp; I say this is his
maul, his club, his master-piece; he doth with this as some do
with their most enchanting songs, sings them everywhere.&nbsp; I
believe there are but few saints in the world that have not had
this temptation sounding in their ears.&nbsp; But were they but
aware, Satan by all this does but drive them to the gap out at
which they should go, and so escape his roaring.</p>
<p>Saith he, thou art a great sinner, a horrible sinner, a
profane hearted wretch, one that cannot be matched for a vile one
in the country.</p>
<p>And all this while Christ says to his ministers, offer mercy,
in the first place, to the biggest sinners.&nbsp; So that this
temptation drives thee directly into the arms of Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>Were therefore the tempted but aware, he might say, Ay, Satan,
so I am, I am a sinner of the biggest size, and therefore have
most need of Jesus Christ; yea, because I am such a wretch,
therefore Jesus Christ calls me; yea, he calls me first: the
first proffer of the Gospel is to be made to the Jerusalem
sinner: I am he, wherefore stand back Satan; make a lane, my
right is first to come to Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>This now will be like for like.&nbsp; This would foil the
devil: this would make him say, I must not deal with this man
thus; for then I put a sword into his hand to cut off my
head.</p>
<p>And this is the meaning of Peter, when he saith, &ldquo;Resist
him stedfast in the faith;&rdquo; 1 Pet. v. 9.&nbsp; And of Paul,
when he saith, &ldquo;Take the shield of faith, wherewith ye
shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked;&rdquo;
Eph. vi. 16.</p>
<p>Wherefore is it said, &ldquo;Begin at Jerusalem,&rdquo; if the
Jerusalem sinner is not to have the benefit of it?&nbsp; And if I
am to have the benefit of it, let me call it to mind when Satan
haunts me with the continual remembrance of my sins, of my
Jerusalem sins.&nbsp; Satan and my conscience say I am the
biggest sinner,&mdash;Christ offereth mercy, in the first place,
to the biggest sinners.&nbsp; Nor is the manner of the offer
other but such as suiteth with my mind.&nbsp; I am sorry for my
sin; yea, sorry at my heart that ever sinful thought did enter,
or find the least entertainment in my wicked mind; and might I
obtain my wish, I would never more that my heart should be a
place for ought but the grace, and spirit, and faith of the Lord
Jesus.</p>
<p>I speak not this to lessen my wickedness; I would not for all
the world but be placed by mine own conscience in the very front
of the biggest sinners, that I might be one of the first that are
beckoned by the gracious hand of Jesus the Saviour, to come to
him for mercy.</p>
<p>Well, sinner, thou now speakest like a Christian, but say thus
in a strong spirit in the hour of temptation, and then thou wilt,
to thy commendation and comfort, quit thyself well.</p>
<p>This improving of Christ in dark hours, is the life, though
the hardest part of our Christianity.&nbsp; We should neither
stop at darkness, nor at the raging of our lusts, but go on in a
way of venturing and casting the whole of our affairs for the
next world at the foot of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; This is the way to
make the darkness light, and also to allay the raging of our
corruption.</p>
<p>The first time the Passover was eaten, was in the night; and
when Israel took courage to go forward, though the sea stood in
their way like a devouring gulf, and the host of the Egyptians
follow them at the heels; yet the sea gives place, and their
enemies were as still as a stone till they were gone over; Exod.
xii. 8; chap. xiv. 13, 14, 21, 22; chap. xv. 16.</p>
<p>There is nothing like faith to help at a pinch; faith
dissolves doubts as the sun drives away the mists.&nbsp; And that
you may not be put out, know your time, as I said, of believing
it always.&nbsp; There are times when some graces may be out of
use, but there is no time wherein faith can be said to be
so.&nbsp; Wherefore faith must be always in exercise.</p>
<p>Faith is the eye, is the mouth, is the hand, and one of these
is of use all day long.&nbsp; Faith is to see, to receive, to
work, or to eat; and a Christian should be seeing or receiving,
or working, or feeding all day long.&nbsp; Let it rain, let it
blow, let it thunder, let it lighten, a Christian must still
believe: &ldquo;At what time,&rdquo; said thee good man, &ldquo;I
am afraid, I will trust in thee;&rdquo; Psal. vi. 2, 3.</p>
<p>Nor can we have a better encouragement to do this, than is by
the text set before us, even an open heart for a Jerusalem
sinner.&nbsp; And if for a Jerusalem sinner to come, then for
such an one when come.&nbsp; If for such a one to be saved, then
for such a one that is saved.&nbsp; If for such a one to be
pardoned his great transgressions, then for such a one who is
pardoned these, to come daily to Jesus Christ, too, to be
cleansed and set free from his common infirmities, and from the
iniquities of his holy things.</p>
<p>Therefore let the poor sinner that would be saved labour for
skill to make the best improvement of the grace of Christ to help
him against the temptations of the devil and his sins.</p>
<p><i>Tenthly</i>, Would Jesus Christ have mercy offered in the
first place to the biggest sinners?&nbsp; Let those men consider
this, that (have, or) may in a day of trial have spoken or done
what their profession or conscience told them they should not,
and that have the guilt and burden thereof upon their
consciences.</p>
<p>Whether a thing be wrong or right, guilt may pursue him that
doth contrary to his conscience.&nbsp; But suppose a man should
deny his God, or his Christ, or relinquish a good profession, and
be under the real guilt thereof; shall he therefore conclude he
is gone for ever?&nbsp; Let him come again with Peter&rsquo;s
tears, and no doubt he shall obtain Peter&rsquo;s
forgiveness.&nbsp; For the text includes the biggest sinners.</p>
<p>And it is observable, that before this clause was put into
this commission, Peter was pardoned his horrible revolt from his
Master.&nbsp; He that revolteth in the day of trial, if he is not
shot quite dead upon the place, but is sensible of his wound, and
calls out for a surgeon, shall find his Lord at hand to pour wine
and oil into his wounds, that he may again be healed, and to
encourage him to think that there may be mercy for him: besides
what we find recorded of Peter, you read in the Acts, some were,
through the violence of their trials, compelled to blaspheme, and
yet are called saints; Acts xxvi. 9&ndash;11.</p>
<p>Hence you have a promise or two that speak concerning such
kind of men, to encourage us to think that at least some of them
shall come back to the Lord their God.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall they
fall,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;and not arise?&nbsp; Shall they
turn away, and not return?&rdquo; Jer. viii. 4.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
in that day I will assemble her that halteth, and I will gather
her that was driven out, and her that I have afflicted.&nbsp; And
I will make her that halteth a remnant, and her that was cast off
a strong nation; and the Lord shall reign over them in Mount Zion
for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; What we are to understand by her that
halteth, is best expressed by the Prophet Elijah; Mic. iv. 6, 7;
Zeph. iii. 19; 1 Kings xviii. 21.</p>
<p>I will conclude, then, that for them that have halted, or may
halt, the Lord has mercy in the bank, and is willing to accept
them if they return to him again.</p>
<p>Perhaps they may never be after that of any great esteem in
the house of God, but if the Lord will admit them to favour and
forgiveness: O exceeding and undeserved mercy!&nbsp; See Ezekiel
xliv. 10&ndash;14.</p>
<p>Thou, then, that mayst be the man, remember this, that there
is mercy also for thee.&nbsp; Return therefore to God, and to his
Son, who hath yet in store for thee, and who will do thee
good.</p>
<p>But perhaps thou wilt say, he doth not save all revolters,
and, therefore, perhaps not me.</p>
<p><i>Answr</i>.&nbsp; Art thou returning to God?&nbsp; If thou
art returning, thou art the man; &ldquo;Return ye backsliding
children, and I will heal your backslidings;&rdquo; Jer. iii.
22.</p>
<p>Some, as I said, that revolt, are shot dead upon the place,
and for them, who can help them?&nbsp; But for them that cry out
of their wounds, it is a sign they are yet alive, and if they use
the means in time, doubtless they may be healed.</p>
<p>Christ Jesus has bags of mercy that were never yet broken up
or unsealed.&nbsp; Hence it is said, he has goodness laid up;
things reserved in heaven for his.&nbsp; And if he breaks up one
of these bags, who can tell what he can do!</p>
<p>Hence his love is said to be such as passeth knowledge, and
that his riches are unsearchable.&nbsp; He has, no body knows
what; for no body knows whom: he has by him in store for such as
seem in the view of all men to be gone beyond recovery.&nbsp; For
this the text is plain.&nbsp; What man or angel could have
thought that the Jerusalem sinners had been yet on this side of
an impossibility of enjoying life and mercy?&nbsp; Hadst thou
seen their actions, and what horrible things they did to the Son
of God; yea, how stoutly they backed what they did with resolves
and endeavours to persevere, when they had killed his person,
against his name and doctrine; and that there was not found among
them all that while, as we read of, the least remorse or regret
for these their doings; couldst thou have imagined that mercy
would ever have took hold of them, at least so soon!&nbsp; Nay,
that they should, of all the world, be counted those only meet to
have it offered to them in the very first place!&nbsp; For so my
text commands, saying, &ldquo;Preach repentance and remission of
sins among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tell you the thing is a wonder, and must for ever stand for
a wonder among the sons of men.&nbsp; It stands also for an
everlasting invitation and allurement to the biggest sinners to
come to Christ for mercy.</p>
<p>Now since, in the opinion of all men, the revolter is such a
one; if he has, as I said before, any life in him, let him take
encouragement to come again, that he may live by Christ.</p>
<p><i>Eleventhly</i>, Would Jesus Christ have mercy offered in
the first place to the biggest sinners?&nbsp; Then let
God&rsquo;s ministers tell them so.&nbsp; There is an incidence
in us, I know not how it doth come about, when we are converted,
to contemn them that are left behind.&nbsp; Poor fools as we are,
we forget that we ourselves were so; Tit. iii. 2, 3.</p>
<p>But would it not become us better, since we have tasted that
the Lord is gracious, to carry it towards them so, that we may
give them convincing ground to believe, that we have found that
mercy which also sets open the door for them to come and partake
with us.</p>
<p>Ministers, I say, should do thus, both by their doctrine, and
in all other respects.</p>
<p>Austerity doth not become us, neither in doctrine nor in
conversation.&nbsp; We ourselves live by grace; let us give as we
receive, and labour to persuade our fellow-sinners which God has
left behind us, to follow after, that they may partake with us of
grace.&nbsp; We are saved by grace, let us live like them that
are gracious.&nbsp; Let all our things (to the world) be done in
charity towards them; pity them, pray for them, be familiar with
them for their good.&nbsp; Let us lay aside our foolish, worldly,
carnal grandeur; let us not walk the streets, and have such
behaviours as signify we are scarce for touching of the poor ones
that are left behind, no not with a pair of tongs.&nbsp; It
becomes us not thus to do.</p>
<p>Remember your Lord, he was familiar with publicans and sinners
to a proverb; &ldquo;Behold a gluttonous man, and a wine-bibber,
a friend of publicans and sinners;&rdquo; Matt. xi. 19.&nbsp; The
first part, concerning his gluttonous eating and drinking, to be
sure, was an horrible slander; but for the other, nothing was
ever spoke truer of him by the world.&nbsp; Now, why should we
lay hands cross on this text: that is, choose good victuals, and
love the sweet wine better than the salvation of the poor
publican?&nbsp; Why not familiar with sinners, provided we hate
their spots and blemishes, and seek that they may be healed of
them?</p>
<p>Why not fellowly with our carnal neighbours?&nbsp; If we do
take occasion to do so, that we may drop, and be yet distilling
some good doctrine upon their souls?&nbsp; Why not go to the poor
man&rsquo;s house, and give him a penny, and a Scripture to think
upon?&nbsp; Why not send for the poor to fetch away at least the
fragments of thy table, that the bowels of thy fellow-sinner may
be refreshed as well as thine?</p>
<p>Ministers should be exemplary; but I am an inferior man, and
must take heed of too much meddling.&nbsp; But might I, I would
meddle with them, with their wives, and with their children
too.&nbsp; I mean not this of all, but of them that deserve it,
though I may not name them.</p>
<p>But, I say, let ministers follow the steps of their blessed
Lord, who by word and deed shewed his love to the salvation of
the world, in such a carriage as declared him to prefer their
salvation before his own private concern, For we are commanded to
follow his steps, &ldquo;who did no sin, neither was guile found
in his mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as I have said concerning ministers, so I say to all the
brethren, carry it so, that all the world may see, that indeed
you are the sons of love.</p>
<p>Love your Saviour; yea, shew one to another that you love him,
not only by a seeming love of affection, but with the love of
duty.&nbsp; Practical love is best.&nbsp; Many love Christ with
nothing but the lick of the tongue.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; Christ
Jesus the Lord must not be put off thus: &ldquo;He that hath my
commandments, and keepeth them,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;he it is
that loveth me;&rdquo; John xiv. 21.</p>
<p>Practical love, which stands in self-denial, in charity to my
neighbour, and a patient enduring of affliction for his name;
this is counted love.</p>
<p>Right love to Christ is that which carries in it a provoking
argument to others of the brethren; Heb. x. 24.</p>
<p>Should a man ask me how he should know that he loveth the
children of God?&nbsp; The best answer I could give him, would be
in the words of the Apostle John; &ldquo;By this,&rdquo; saith
he, &ldquo;we know we love the children of God, when we love God,
and keep his commandments;&rdquo; 1 John, v. 2.</p>
<p>Love to God and Christ is then shewn when we are tender of his
name; and then we shew ourselves tender of his name when we are
afraid to break any the least of his commandments.&nbsp; And when
we are here, then do we shew our love to our brother also.</p>
<p>Now, we have obligation sufficient thus to do, for that our
Lord loved us, and gave himself for us, to deliver us from death,
that we might live through him.</p>
<p>The world, when they hear the doctrine that I have asserted
and handled in this little book; to wit, that Jesus Christ would
have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners,
will be apt, because themselves are unbelievers, to think that
this is a doctrine that leads to looseness, and that gives
liberty to the flesh; but if you that believe love your brethren
and your neighbours truly, and as you should, you will put to
silence the ignorance of such foolish men, and stop their mouths
from speaking evil of you.</p>
<p>And, I say, let the love of Christ constrain us to this.&nbsp;
Who deserveth our heart, our mouth, our life, our goods, so much
as Jesus Christ, who has bought us to himself by his blood, to
this very end, that we should be a peculiar people, zealous of
good works?</p>
<p>There is nothing more seemly in the world, than to see a
Christian walk as becomes the Gospel; nor any thing more
unbecoming a reasonable creature, than to hear a man say, I
believe in Christ, and yet see in his life debauchery and
profaneness.&nbsp; Might I, such men should be counted the basest
of men; such men should be counted by all unworthy of the name of
a Christian, and should be shunned by every good man, as such who
are the very plague of profession.</p>
<p>For so it is written, we should carry it towards them.&nbsp;
Whoso have a form of godliness, and deny the power thereof, from
such we must turn away.</p>
<p>It has ofttimes come into my mind to ask, by what means it is
that the gospel profession should be so tainted with loose and
carnal gospellers? and I could never arrive to better
satisfaction in the matter than this,&mdash;such men are made
professors by the devil, and so by him put among the rest of the
godly.&nbsp; A certain man had a fruitless fig-tree planted in
his vineyard; but by whom was it planted there?&nbsp; Even by him
that sowed the tares, his own children, among the wheat; Luke
xiii. 6; Matt. xiii. 37&ndash;40.&nbsp; And that was the
devil.&nbsp; But why doth the devil do thus?&nbsp; Not of love to
them, but to make of them offences and stumblingblocks to
others.&nbsp; For he knows that a loose professor in the church
does more mischief to religion than ten can do to it that are in
the world.</p>
<p>Was it not, think you, the devil that stirred up the damsel
that you read of in Acts xvi., to cry out, &ldquo;These are the
servants of the most high God, that shew unto us the way of
salvation!&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes it was, as is evident, for Paul was
grieved to hear it.&nbsp; But why did the devil stir up her to
cry so? but because that was the way to blemish the Gospel, and
to make the world think that it came from the same hand as did
her soothsaying and witchery; verse 16&ndash;18; &ldquo;Holiness,
O Lord, becomes thy house for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let, therefore, whoever they be that profess the name of
Christ, take heed that they scandal not that profession which
they make of him, since he has so graciously offered us, as we
are sinners of the biggest size, in the first place, his grace to
save us.</p>
<p>Having thus far spoken of the riches of the grace of Christ,
and of the freeness of his heart to embrace the Jerusalem
sinners, it may not be amiss to give you yet, as a caution, an
intimation of one thing, namely, that this grace and freeness of
his heart is limited to time and day; the which, whoso
overstandeth, shall perish notwithstanding.</p>
<p>For as a king, who, of grace, sendeth out to his rebellious
people an offer of pardon, if they accept thereof by such a day,
yet beheadeth or hangeth those that come not in for mercy until
the day or time be past; so Christ Jesus has set the sinner a
day, a day of salvation, an acceptable time; but he who standeth
out, or goeth on in rebellion beyond that time, is like to come
off with the loss of his soul; 2 Cor. vi. 2; Heb. iii. 13, 16,
17, 18, 19; chap. iv. 7; Luke xix. 41, 42.</p>
<p>Since, therefore, things are thus, it may be convenient here
to touch a little upon these particulars.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, That this day, or time thus limited, when it is
considered with reference to this or that man, is ofttimes
undiscerned by the person concerned therein, and always is kept
secret as to the shutting up thereof.</p>
<p>And this, in the wisdom of God, is thus to the end; no man,
when called upon, should put off turning to God to another
time.&nbsp; Now, and to-day, is that and only that which is
revealed in holy writ; Psal. 1. 22; Eccles. xii. 1; Heb. iii. 13,
16.</p>
<p>And this shews us the desperate hazards which those men run,
who when invitation or conviction attends them, put off turning
to God to be saved till another, and, as they think, a more fit
season and time.&nbsp; For many, by so doing, defer this to do
till the day of God&rsquo;s patience and long-suffering is ended;
and then, for their prayers and cries after mercy, they receive
nothing but mocks, and are laughed at by the God of heaven; Prov.
i. 20&ndash;30; Isaiah lxv. 12&ndash;16; chap. lxvi. 4; Zech.
xii. 11&ndash;13.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, Another thing to be considered is this, viz.
that the day of God&rsquo;s grace with some men begins sooner,
and also sooner ends than it doth with others.&nbsp; Those at the
first hour of the day, had their call sooner than they who were
called upon to turn to God at the sixth hour of the day; yea, and
they who were hired at the third hour, had their call sooner than
they who were called at the eleventh; Matt. xx. 1&ndash;6.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The day of God&rsquo;s patience began with Ishmael,
and also ended before he was twenty years old.&nbsp; At thirteen
years of age he was circumcised; the next year after Isaac was
born; and then Ishmael was fourteen years old.&nbsp; Now that day
that Isaac was weaned, that day was Ishmael rejected; and suppose
that Isaac was three years old before he was weaned, that was but
the seventeenth year of Ishmael; wherefore the day of God&rsquo;s
grace was ended with him betimes; Gen. xvii. 24, 25; chap. xxi.
2&ndash;11; Gal. iv. 30.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Cain&rsquo;s day ended with him betimes; for after
God had rejected him, he lived to beget many children, and build
a city, and to do many other things.&nbsp; But alas! all that
while he was a fugitive and a vagabond.&nbsp; Nor carried he any
thing with him after the day of his rejection was come, but this
doleful language in his conscience, &ldquo;From God&rsquo;s face
shall I be hid;&rdquo; Gen. iv. 10&ndash;15.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Esau, through his extravagancies would needs go to
sell his birth-right, not fearing (as other confident fools) but
that yet the blessing would still be his, after which he lived
many years; but all of them under the wrath of God, as was, when
time came, made appear to his destruction; for &ldquo;When he
would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected, for he found
no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with
tears;&rdquo; Heb. xii. 14&ndash;16.</p>
<p>Many instances might be given as to such tokens of the
displeasure of God against such as fool away, as the wise man has
it, the prize which is put into their hand; Prov. xvii. 16.</p>
<p>Let these things, therefore, be a further caution to those
that sit under the glorious sound of the Gospel, and hear of the
riches of the grace of God in Christ to poor sinners.</p>
<p>To slight grace, to despise mercy, and to stop the ear when
God speaks, when he speaks such great things, so much to our
profit, is a great provocation.</p>
<p>He offereth, he calls, he woos, he invites, he prays, he
beseeches us in this day of his grace to be reconciled to him;
yea, and has provided for us the means of reconciliation
himself.&nbsp; Now, this despised must needs be provoking; and it
is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</p>
<p>But some man may say unto me, Fain I would be saved, fain I
would be saved by Christ; but I fear this day of grace is past,
and that I shall perish, notwithstanding the exceeding riches of
the grace of God.</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>.&nbsp; To this doubt I would answer several
things.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, With respect to this day.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, With respect to thy desires.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>, With respect to thy fears.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, With respect to the day; that is, whether it be
ended with a man or no.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Art thou jogged, and shaken and molested at the
hearing of the Word?&nbsp; Is thy conscience awakened and
convinced then that thou art at present in a perishing state, and
that thou hast need to cry to God for mercy?&nbsp; This is a
hopeful sign that this day of grace is not past with thee.&nbsp;
For usually they that are past grace, are also, in their
conscience, past feeling, being &ldquo;seared with an hot
iron;&rdquo; Eph. iv. 18, 19; 1 Tim. iv. 1, 2.</p>
<p>Consequently, those past grace must be such as are denied the
awakening fruits of the Word preached.&nbsp; &ldquo;The dead that
hear,&rdquo; says Christ, &ldquo;shall live;&rdquo; at least
while Christ has not quite done with them; the day of God&rsquo;s
patience is not at an end with them; John v. 25.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Is there in thy more retired condition, arguings,
strugglings, and strivings with thy spirit to persuade thee of
the vanity of what vain things thou lovest, and to win thee in
thy soul to a choice of Christ Jesus and his heavenly
things?&nbsp; Take heed and rebel not, for the day of God&rsquo;s
grace and patience will not be past with thee till he saith his
&ldquo;Spirit shall strive no more&rdquo; with thee; for then the
woe comes, when &ldquo;he shall depart from them;&rdquo; and when
he says to the means of grace, &ldquo;Let them alone;&rdquo; Hos.
iv. 17; chap. ix. 12.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Art thou visited in the night-seasons with dreams
about thy state, and that thou art in danger of being lost?&nbsp;
Hast thou heart-shaken apprehensions when deep sleep is upon
thee, of hell, death, and judgment to come?&nbsp; These are signs
that God has not wholly left thee, or cast thee behind his back
for ever.&nbsp; &ldquo;For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man
perceiveth it not; in a dream, in a vision of the night, when
deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed; then he
openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction, that he
may withdraw man from his purpose (his sinful purposes) and hide
pride from man;&rdquo; Job xxxiii. 14&ndash;17.</p>
<p>All this while God has not left the sinner, nor is come to the
end of his patience towards him, but stands at least with the
door of grace a-jar in his hand, as being loth as yet to bolt it
against him.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Art thou followed with affliction, and dost thou hear
God&rsquo;s angry voice in thy afflictions?&nbsp; Doth he send
with thy affliction an interpreter to shew thee thy vileness; and
why, or wherefore, the hand of God is upon thee, and upon what
thou hast; to wit, that it is for thy sinning against him, and
that thou mightest be turned to him?&nbsp; If so, thy summer is
not quite ended; thy harvest is not quite over and gone.&nbsp;
Take heed, stand out no longer, lest he cause darkness, and lest
thy feet stumble upon the dark mountains; and lest, while you
look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it
gross darkness; Jer. viii. 20; chap. xiii. 15&ndash;17.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Art thou crossed, disappointed, and way-laid, and
overthrown in all thy foolish ways and doings?&nbsp; This is a
sign God has not quite left thee, but that he still waits upon
thee to turn thee.&nbsp; Consider, I say, has he made a hedge and
a wall to stop thee?&nbsp; Has he crossed thee in all thou
puttest thy hand unto?&nbsp; Take it as a call to turn to him,
for, by his thus doing, he shews he has a mind to give thee a
better portion.&nbsp; For usually when God gives up men, and
resolves to let them alone in the broad way, he gives them rope,
and lets them have their desires in all hurtful things; Hos. ii.
6&ndash;15; Psalm lxxiii. 3&ndash;13; Rom. xi. 9.</p>
<p>Therefore take heed to this also, that thou strive not against
this hand of God; but betake thyself to a serious inquiry into
the causes of this hand of God upon thee, and incline to think,
it is because the Lord would have thee look to that, which is
better than what thou wouldst satisfy thyself withal.&nbsp; When
God had a mind to make the prodigal go home to his father, he
sent a famine upon him, and denied him a bellyful of the husks
which the swine did eat.&nbsp; And observe it, now he was in a
strait, he betook him to consideration of the good that there was
in his father&rsquo;s house; yea, he resolved to go home to his
father, and his father dealt well with him; he received him with
music and dancing, because he had received him safe and sound;
Luke xv. 14&ndash;32.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Hast then any enticing thoughts of the word of God
upon thy mind?&nbsp; Doth, as it were, some holy word of God give
a glance upon thee, cast a smile upon thee, let fall, though it
be but one drop of its savour upon thy spirit; yea, though it
stays but one moment with thee?&nbsp; O then the day of grace is
not past!&nbsp; The gate of heaven is not shut! nor God&rsquo;s
heart and bowels withdrawn from thee as yet.&nbsp; Take heed,
therefore, and beware that thou make much of the heavenly gift,
and of that good word of God of the which he has made thee
taste.&nbsp; Beware, I say, and take heed; there may be a falling
away for all this; but, I say, as yet God has not left thee, as
yet he has not cast thee off; Heb. vi. 1&ndash;9.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, With respect to thy desires, what are
they?&nbsp; Wouldst thou be saved!&nbsp; Wouldst thou be saved
with a thorough salvation?&nbsp; Wouldst thou be saved from guilt
and filth too?&nbsp; Wouldst thou be the servant of thy
Saviour?&nbsp; Art thou indeed weary of the service of thy old
master the devil, sin, and the world?&nbsp; And have these
desires put thy soul to flight?&nbsp; Hast thou through desires
betaken thyself to thy heels?&nbsp; Dost fly to him that is a
Saviour from the wrath to come, for life?&nbsp; If these be thy
desires, and if they be unfeigned, fear not.&nbsp; Thou art one
of those runaways which God has commanded our Lord to receive,
and not to send thee back to the devil thy master again, but to
give thee a place in his house, even the place which liketh thee
best.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou shalt not deliver to his master,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;the servant which is escaped from his master unto
thee.&nbsp; He shall dwell with thee, even among you in that
place which he shall choose, in one of thy gates where it liketh
him best; thou shalt not oppress him;&rdquo; Deut. xxiii. 15,
16.</p>
<p>This is a command to the church, consequently to the Head of
the church; for all commands from God come to her through her
Head.&nbsp; Whence I conclude, that as Israel of old was to
receive the runaway servant who escaped from a heathen master to
them, and should not dare to send him back to his master again,
so Christ&rsquo;s church now, and consequently Christ himself,
may not, will not, refuse that soul that has made his escape from
sin, Satan, the world, and hell, unto him, but will certainly let
him dwell in his house, among his saints, in that place which he
shall choose, even where it liketh him best.&nbsp; For he says in
another place, &ldquo;And him that cometh to me, I will in no
wise cast out.&rdquo;&nbsp; In no wise, let his crimes be what
they will, either for nature, multitude, or the attendance of
aggravating circumstances.</p>
<p>Wherefore, if thy desires be firm, sound, and unfeigned to
become the saved of Christ, and his servant, fear not, he will
not, he will in no wise put thee away, or turn thee over to thy
old master again.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>, As to they fears, whatever they are, let that
be supposed which is supposed before, and they are groundless,
and so of no weight.</p>
<p><i>Object</i>.&nbsp; But I am afraid I am not elected, or
chosen to salvation, though you called me fool a little before
for so fearing.</p>
<p><i>Ans</i>.&nbsp; Though election is, in order, before
calling, as to God, yet the knowledge of calling must go before
the belief of my election as to myself.&nbsp; Wherefore, souls
that doubt of the truth of their effectual calling, do but plunge
themselves into a deeper labyrinth of confusion that concern
themselves with their election; I mean, while they labour to know
it before they prove their calling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Make your
calling, and so your election, sure;&rdquo; 2 Pet. i.
4&ndash;11.</p>
<p>Wherefore, at present, lay the thoughts of thy election by,
and ask thyself these questions: Do I see my lost
condition?&nbsp; Do I see salvation is nowhere but in
Christ?&nbsp; Would I share in this salvation by faith in
him?&nbsp; And would I, as was said before, be thoroughly saved,
to wit, from the filth as from the guilt?&nbsp; Do I love Christ,
his Father, his saints, his words, and ways?&nbsp; This is the
way to prove we are elect.&nbsp; Wherefore, sinner, when Satan,
or thine own heart seeks to puzzle thee with election, say thou,
I cannot attend to talk of this point now, but stay till I know
that I am called of God to the fellowship of his Son, and then I
will shew you that I am elect, and that my name is written in the
book of life.</p>
<p>If poor distressed souls would observe this order, they might
save themselves the trouble of an unprofitable labour under these
unreasonable and soul-sinking doubts.</p>
<p>Let us therefore, upon the sight of our wretchedness, fly and
venturously leap into the arms of Christ, which are now as open
to receive us into his bosom, as they were when nailed to the
cross.&nbsp; This is coming to Christ for life aright; this is
right running away from thy master to him, as was said
before.&nbsp; And for this we have multitudes of scriptures to
support, encourage, and comfort us in our so doing.</p>
<p>But now, let him that doth thus be sure to look for it, for
Satan will be with him to-morrow, to see if he can get him again
to his old service; and if he cannot do that, then will he enter
into dispute with him, to wit, about whether he be elect to life,
and called indeed to partake of this Christ, to whom he is fled
for succour, or whether he comes to him of his own presumptuous
mind.&nbsp; Therefore we are bid, as to come, so to arm ourselves
with that armour which God has provided; that we may resist,
quench, stand against, and withstand all the fiery darts of the
devil; Eph. vi. 11&ndash;18.</p>
<p>If, therefore, thou findest Satan in this order to march
against thee, remember then thou hadst this item about it; and
betake thyself to faith and good courage; and be sober, and hope
to the end.</p>
<p><i>Object</i>.&nbsp; But how if I should have sinned the sin
unpardonable, or that called the sin against the Holy Ghost?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>.&nbsp; If thou hast, thou art lost for ever; but
yet before it is concluded by thee that thou hast so sinned, know
that they that would be saved by Jesus Christ through faith in
his blood, cannot be counted for such.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Because of the promise, for that must not be
frustrated: and that says, &ldquo;And him that cometh to Christ,
he will in no wise cast out.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again, &ldquo;Whoso
will, let him take of the water of life freely;&rdquo; John vi.
37; Rev. xxi. 6; chap. xxii. 17.</p>
<p>But I say, how can these scriptures be fulfilled, if he that
would indeed be saved, as before, has sinned the sin
unpardonable?&nbsp; The scriptures must not be made void, nor
their truth be cast to the ground.&nbsp; Here is a promise, and
here is a sinner; a promise that says he shall not be cast out
that comes; and the sinner comes, wherefore he must be received:
consequently he that comes to Christ for life, has not, cannot
have sinned that sin for which there is no forgiveness.</p>
<p>And this might suffice for an answer to any coming soul, that
fears, though he comes, that he has sinned the sin against the
Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; But again, he that has sinned the sin against the
Holy Ghost cannot come, has no heart to come, can by no means be
made willing to come to Jesus Christ for life; for that he has
received such an opinion of him, and of his things, as deters and
holds him back.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; He counteth this blessed person, the Son of God, a
magician, a conjuror, a witch, or one that did, when he was in
the world, what he did by the power and spirit of the devil;
Matt. ix. 34; chap. xii. 24, 25, &amp;c.; Mark iii.
22&ndash;30.&nbsp; Now he that has this opinion of this Jesus,
cannot be willing to cast himself at his feet for life, or to
come to him as the only way to God and to salvation.&nbsp; And
hence it is said again, that such an one puts him to open shame,
and treadeth him under foot, that is, by contemning, reproaching,
vilifying, and despising of him, as if he were the vilest one, or
the greatest cheat in the world: and has therefore, as to his
esteem of him, called him accursed, crucified him to himself, or
counted him one hanged, as one of the worst of malefactors; Heb.
vi. 6; chap. x. 29; 1 Cor. xii. 3.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; His blood, which is the meritorious cause of
man&rsquo;s redemption, even the blood of the everlasting
covenant, he counteth an unholy thing, or that which has no more
virtue in it to save a soul from sin than has the blood of a dog;
Heb. x. 29.&nbsp; For when the Apostle says, &ldquo;he counts it
an unholy thing,&rdquo; he means, he makes it of less value than
that of a sheep or cow, which were clean according to the law;
and therefore must mean, that his blood was of no more worth to
him in his account than was the blood of a dog, an ass, or a
swine, which always was, as to sacrifices, rejected by the God of
heaven, as unholy or unclean.</p>
<p>Now he who has no better esteem of Jesus Christ, and of his
death and blood, will not be persuaded to come to him for life,
or to trust in him for salvation.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; But further, all this must be done against manifest
tokens to prove the contrary, or after the shining of gospel
light upon the soul, or some considerable profession of him as
the Messiah, or that he was the Saviour of the world.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; It must be done against manifest tokens to prove the
contrary; and thus the reprobate Jews committed it when they saw
the works of God, which put forth themselves in him, and called
them the works of the devil and Beelzebub.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; It must be done against some shining light of the
gospel upon them.&nbsp; And thus it was with Judas, and with
those who, after they were enlightened, and had tasted, and had
felt something of the powers of the world to come, fell away from
the faith of him, and put him to open shame and disgrace; Heb.
vi. 5, 6.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; It must also be done after, and in opposition to
one&rsquo;s own open profession of him.&nbsp; &ldquo;For if after
they have escaped the pollution of the world, through the
knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again
entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with
them than the beginning; for it had been better for them not to
have known the way of righteousness, than after they have known
it, to turn from the holy commandment (which is the word of
faith) delivered unto them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; All this must be done openly, before witnesses, in
the face, sight, and view of the world, by word and act.&nbsp;
This is the sin that is unpardonable; and he that hath thus done,
can never, it is impossible he ever should be renewed again to
repentance, and that for a double reason; for such an one doth
say, he will not; and of him God says, he shall not have the
benefit of salvation by him.</p>
<p><i>Object</i>.&nbsp; But if this be the sin unpardonable, why
is it called the sin against the Holy Ghost, and not rather the
sin against the Son of God?</p>
<p><i>Answ</i>.&nbsp; It is called &ldquo;the sin against the
Holy Ghost,&rdquo; because such count the works he did, which
were done by the Spirit of God, the works of the spirit of the
devil.&nbsp; Also because all such as so reject Christ Jesus the
Lord, they do it in despite of that testimony which the Holy
Ghost has given of him in the holy scriptures; for the scriptures
are the breathings of the Holy Ghost, as in all other things, so
in that testimony they bear of the person, of the works,
sufferings, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Sinner, this is the sin against the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; What
sayst thou?&nbsp; Hast thou committed it?&nbsp; Nay, I know thou
hast not; if thou wouldst be saved by Christ.&nbsp; Yea, it is
impossible that thou shouldst have done it, if indeed thou
wouldst be saved by him.</p>
<p>No man can desire to be saved by him, whom he yet judgeth to
be an impostor, a magician, a witch.&nbsp; No man can hope for
redemption by that blood which he yet counteth an unholy
thing.&nbsp; Nor will God ever suffer such an one to repent, who
has, after light and profession of him, thus horribly and
devil-like contemned and trampled upon him.</p>
<p>True, words and wars and blasphemies against this Son of man
are pardonable; but then they must be done ignorantly and in
unbelief.&nbsp; Also all blasphemous thoughts are likewise such
as may be passed by, if the soul afflicted with them indeed is
sorry for them; 1 Tim. i. 13&ndash;15; Mar. iii. 28.</p>
<p>All but this, sinner, all but this!&nbsp; If God had said, he
will forgive one sin, it had been undeserved grace; but when he
says he will pardon all but one, this is grace to the height.</p>
<p>Nor is that one unpardonable otherwise, but because the
Saviour that should save them is rejected and put away.</p>
<p>We read of Jacob&rsquo;s ladder; Christ is Jacob&rsquo;s
ladder that reacheth up to heaven, and he that refuseth to go by
this ladder thither, will scarce by other means get up so
high.</p>
<p>There is none other name given under heaven among men whereby
we must be saved.&nbsp; There is none other sacrifice for sin
than this; he also, and he only, is the Mediator that reconcileth
men to God.&nbsp; And, sinner, if thou wouldst be saved by him,
his benefits are thine; yea, though thou art a great and
Jerusalem transgressor.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
